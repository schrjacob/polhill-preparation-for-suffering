# CHAPTER IV

*Preparation for suffering: the first direction is, Try thy heart, see the deceit of it; what relics of sin are there; how it steals out of duties; how false it is in promises; how it extenuates sin—Search and see what uprightness is there—Doth thy heart set God before thee; doth it respect all commands; doth it eye God’s glory, and did it make a right contract with Christ?*

Having spoken somewhat in general touching preparation for suffering, I now come to speak of it more particularly. And here I shall lay down several directions, and show how a christian may be in a fit posture for suffering.

1. If we would be in a fit posture for suffering, let us diligently try our own hearts. Suffering is a searching thing; it tries a man, as fire doth metals; sifts and winnows him as corn is shaken in a sieve; and discovers his thoughts, and the bottom of his heart. Many a man seems to be fully for God, yet when the test comes, proves to be for the world. Therefore, it is very proper for us to search ourselves beforehand; to try our hearts inwardly before the outward trial come; to sift and winnow ourselves, before Providence do it; to discover our hearts to ourselves, before God discover them to others. This is God’s own direction to his people: “Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not desired;” or, as the words of the original may be rendered, “Search, lift yourselves; yea, search, lift yourselves, O nation not desired, before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you, before the day of the Lord’s anger come upon you,” (Zeph. 2:1, 2). Approaching judgments alarm us to self-examination. Sit down, O christian, and consider what the state of thy heart is; what of corruption is there and what of grace; how much is there for the world, and how much for God; what concupiscential strings are there that tie thee to the present world, and what anchors cast in heaven are there to bear thee up in a storm; what chaff or vanity is there that will go away with every wind, and what massy grace that will abide the trial. Never is it more necessary to descend into ourselves, than in a time of suffering.

Search out the corruption and deceitfulness in thy heart. If thou wilt believe him that knows the heart better than it knows itself, “The heart is deceitful above all things,” (Jer. 17:9); full of windings and turnings; deceitful beyond its own power of reflection; which, when acted, knows the deceit in part, but cannot dive into the bottom of it. Commune with thine own heart, O christian; ask it seriously, is there not much corruption within? are there not relics of unbelief, earthiness, sensualness, pride, hypocrisy, apostacy found in thee? Consider what these are; these fight under the same colours, and aim at the same end with the persecuting world; these would root grace out of thy heart, as wicked men would root good out of the world. As it was with Israel, there went up with them out of Egypt a mixed multitude, which was ready to return again thither; so it is with good men; there are corrupt mixtures in them which would turn back to Egypt again. Be not deceived; thy whole entire self is not for suffering; the unregenerate part will hang back, and say to thee, as Satan in Peter did to our Saviour, Master, spare thyself. When dangers approach, the flesh will cry out, Oh, spare thy estate, spare thy relations, spare thy life. Why shouldest thou destroy thyself? Take notice therefore, that there is a traitor in thine own bosom, which, unless thou watch, will, like the idolater’s deceived heart, turn thee aside from God. Again, ask thy heart, Doth it not steal out of holy duties? When thou art a hearing the holy word, will not thy heart go out to worldly objects? When thou art joining with others in prayer, do not thy thoughts rove up and down about carnal things? If thy heart be a little elevated towards heaven, doth it not immediately fall down again? If it be a little inflamed towards God, doth it not instantly cool again? Think with thyself; that heart, that steals away from duties in which there is nothing grievous to the body, will be ready to steal away from sufferings, which grate upon the flesh and sense. Thou hadst need to get thy heart fixed on God in duties, that when thou comest to suffering, thou mayest not start away from him. Further yet, ask thy heart; Hath it not been false in vows and promises of better obedience, and those made at sacraments or upon sick beds? Is not thy goodness as a morning cloud, and thy life a vain circle of commissions of sin and confessions? And canst thou trust such a heart as this? Assure thyself, that a heart, which is false in promises, will not be true in sufferings; that goodness that passes away like the early dew at other times, will utterly vanish when a scorching persecution comes. Learn, therefore, to be true in promises, that thou mayest be true in suffering; get such a real goodness as may abide the trial in an evil day. Moreover, ask thyself one question more: Cannot thy heart colour over evil things? Is it not apt to extenuate sin and say, It is but a little one; to make nothing of idle words or petty oaths? And what may not such a heart do to avoid sufferings? May it not put a fair gloss upon popery itself, and say, the papists have the substance of religion, and why should we scruple human rights and ceremonies? They have the sacred scriptures, and why should we stumble at superfluous traditions? Their images are not the terminative object of worship, but the motive only; and why may we not use human inventions to move us to devotion? Transubstantiation itself is but a kind of nicety; they say, the body of Christ is in the Eucharist after the manner of spirits; we say, that it is there spiritually. And how little doth the difference seem to be? Praying to saints and angels is but a vanity, a void thing. Human merit is a harmless thing, if it be grafted upon Christ and the promise. The pope himself is a bishop, and what need we think him antichrist? The false heart can paint the whore in every part, and make her look as if she were not mystery, Babylon, the mother of harlots, and abominations of the earth. Labour, then, to know more and more of the deceitfulness of thy heart, that it may not cheat thee in times of persecution. He that trusts in his heart is a fool, nay, a secret idolater; let us carry a holy jealousy over our hearts. The carnal heart will presume, but knows not its own weakness; it will promise much, but perform little or nothing. Peter was in a very high strain, “Though all men be offended, yet will not I,” (Matth. 26:33). And again, “Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee,” (ver. 35). But alas, he was herein, as Forus observes, but a figure of those that lean upon their own free-will; he knew too little of himself, presumed too much upon his own power, and fell miserably in the denial of his Lord. This great pillar fell before the breath of a poor damsel; his confidence and presumption proved but a mere vanity. Do not, O christian, think thyself better than this great apostle; study thine own heart, and see the corruption there, that thou mayest not fall by presumption; but stand in the power of his grace, who is able to confirm thee to the end.

2. Search thy heart, and see what uprightness is there. Thou hast a name, a notion of religion, a form of godliness; but hast thou the thing, the truth of grace, the power of religion in thy, heart? It is grace, true grace, that must establish the heart, (Heb. 13:9). It is gold tried in the fire, (Rev. 3:18), that is, pure grace, that must endure the fiery trial. Consider thyself, O Christian, Is there any true integrity in thee? Where are the marks and characters of it appearing in thee? Put interrogatories to thine own heart. Dost thou indeed set the Lord always before thee? Dost thou do everything as in his presence, and under his eye. This is very comfortable; he that truly walks with God in other things, will, through grace, walk with him in sufferings too. He that hath a holy respect to God’s presence and eye at other time, will have so in a time of trial also. The constancy of God’s people, set forth in Psalm 44 is very observable; they were given as sheep for meat, sold for nought, made a reproach, and a scorn, a bye-word, and a shaking of the head among the people; yet their heart was not turned back, neither did their steps decline from God’s ways, (ver. 18). They were broken in the place of dragons, covered in the shadow of death; yet they did not forget the name of their God, nor stretch out their hands to a strange god, (ver. 20). And whence was this close adherence unto God? The reason is rendered in the 21st ver.; if they should forsake God, he would search them out, for he knoweth the secrets of the heart. We see how they were affected with the presence and all-seeing eye of God, and how doth it affect us? If it make us depart from other sins, it will much more make us depart from so great a sin as apostacy is. Again, art thou true in thy active obedience to God? Hast thou an universal respect to all the commands, even to those that call for right hands and right eyes? This is very well; he that is true in active obedience, will be so in passive; he that is for all the commands of God, will be for the command of taking up the cross, and suffering for Christ. The commands are copulative, one of them is linked to another; the stamp of divine authority is upon all; the glory of God is concerned in all; they are all united in the root of charity. Those principles of grace which prompt to the obedience of one, will prompt to the obedience of all: he that is sincere in doing, will be sincere in suffering. Further, hast thou a single eye, a pure intention at the great end? Is it thy real aim that God in all things may be glorified? This is a good sign; he that hath a single eye in one thing, will have it in another; he that glorifies God in other things, will glorify him in sufferings too. A man is as his end is; what the form is in naturals, that the end is in morals. He, that hath God for his centre and ultimate end, will embrace all the mediums that tend thither, and suffering as the highest medium of all; therein is the highest love demonstrated, and God is practically lifted up above all; his glory is upon the throne; and estates, relations, lives, all earthly concerns are at the footstool. Let us set our hearts upon the great end, that, whether we be doing God’s commanding will, or suffering under his disposing one, the great design of God’s glory may be still carried on by us. Moreover, ask thyself what was thy original contract with Jesus Christ? How, and upon what terms didst thou espouse him? Didst thou take him entirely as he is offered in the gospel? Didst thou take him, cross and all? Didst thou sit down and count what Christianity might cost thee? It may be thou mayest be called to part with all—to hate father, mother, wife, children, life itself, for Christ: didst thou deliberately consider these things, and yet piously resolve that thou wouldst have Christ, whatever he cost thee? This is very excellent—thou art now a martyr in purpose, and virtually hast swallowed down all the persecutions that go along with the gospel; when the cross comes, thou wilt take it up upon thy back; the flesh possibly may murmur, but thou wilt say, this was my original contract with Christ; these were the terms of my espousals; I accept the cross, and will follow my suffering Saviour; he is worthy for whom I suffer, and the sufferings are not worthy to be compared with the glory to come: let us therefore be sure that we have made a right contract with Christ and accepted him, cross and all, that when sufferings come, we may not fall off from h
