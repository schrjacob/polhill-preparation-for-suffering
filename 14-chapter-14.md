# Chapter XIV

*Some inducements to suffer anything, rather than part with the pure religion—Pious sufferers glorify God; they propagate the church: they give a token of wrath to come upon persecutors; they are happy here and hereafter: here in the proof of sincerity, and in the presence of God; hereafter in a freedom from all evil, and a communication of all good.*

Having laid down directions in order to suffering, I will shut up all with a few considerations, which may serve as motives to induce us at God’s call to suffer anything rather than part with the pure religion, which is a jewel incomparably more worth than all those things, which we can lose for it.

1. Pious sufferers do glorify God in a very signal eminent manner. What is said of St. Peter’s death? that “It was a glorifying of God,” (John 21:19). The same may be said of the death of all other martyrs; we glorify God by offering praise; much more by offering our lives for him. We glorify him by giving some of our estates in charity; much more, by giving our blood for his name. We glorify him, when we present our bodies a living sacrifice to him in active obedience, much more when we present them a dying one in passive. Much of the glory of God breaks forth in his suffering saints; free-grace shines out in the raising up witnesses to his truth in a contradicting, persecuting world; power admirably appears in bearing of them up with holy joy and pleasure, in the midst of all the torments which men and devils can invent against them. Excellent is that of the apostle: “Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness,” (Col. 1:11). God’s power is glorious in other things, but in his suffering saints, it lets out itself in a most illustrious manner. The persecutors have all torments, all kinds of death; but the martyrs have all might, all patience, and long-suffering with joyfulness. As it was with Christ, his power appeared in miracles; but above all, in that he triumphed over principalities and powers upon the cross: so it is with christians; the divine power appears in other graces, but above all in that patient suffering which overcomes the world. The truth of God is in martyrs practically proved to be exceeding precious. The fathers, in the first general councils, were so earnest for the truth, that they would not exchange a letter or syllable of it. The Arian ὁμοιούσιος would not pass instead of ὁμοούσιος, nor the Nestorian θεοδόχος, applied to Christ as man, instead of θεοτόχος, applied to the blessed virgin. All believers seal up the evangelical truths by faith, but the martyrs seal them up by their blood also; plainly shewing, that the least jot or tittle of truth is more worth than life, and not to be sold for a world. It was the preciousness of truth, that made Athanasius stand it out against an Arian world, and Luther stand it out against a Popish one. Moreover, divine worship is by martyrs maintained to be a prerogative due to God alone. When all the world was given to idolatry, the primitive martyrs would die, rather than rob God of his honour. Their sufferings told the world that his glory was not to be given to another, nor his praise to graven images; no, not to save the lives of those that were the only pure worshippers of him. Their lives could not be better spent than in suffering for his pure worship; and after them, he would raise up others to worship him. When the emperor Commodus asked the senator Julius why he could not worship Jupiter and Hercules; Julius, ambitious of martyrdom, told the emperor plainly, that Jupiter and Hercules were no gods, and that the worshippers of idols must perish in eternal torments; and soon after, he sealed up his profession with his blood. Auxentius would rather suffer banishment, than set a branch of a wine-tree at the feet of Bacchus’ image, because it had an appearance of idolatry. The suffering of the saints for the pure worship, proclaims it to all, that God hath a sacred jealousy over his worship, and will no more part with it, than he will with his crown. If we would indeed glorify God, here is the highest medium to do it; no praises, no alms, no services, no active obedience, do so lift up the glory of God, as pious suffering doth, in which we do practically declare that we value him above all things.

2. Pious sufferers do propagate and multiply the church. When Abel, the first martyr, was slain, there was a Seth raised up in his room. When righteous persons are slain by persecutors, more of them spring up in the church. The more the children of Israel were afflicted in Egypt, the more they multiplied and grew, (Exod. 1:11). As the ground, that is most harrowed, is most fruitful; so God’s people, the more they were straitened under the burdens of men, the more they were enlarged by the blessing of God. The Roman emperors did design utterly to extirpate Christianity: Dioclesian (the greatest persecutor of all, who filled the world with the blood of martyrs) thought he had effected it: this inscription was upon his coin. “Nomine christianorum deleto, qui rem publicam everterunt” the name of christians, who overthrew the Commonwealth, is extinct: but they were all in a mistake; in the midst of the ten bloody persecutions, there was still a new generation of christians springing up out of the blood of the martyrs. Tertullian tells the vexing torturing persecutors, “Plures efficimur, quoties metimur; semen est sanguis christianorum:” the more we are mowed and cut down, the more we grow and multiply: the blood of christians is the seed of the church. St. Austain saith of the persecuted christians, “Cœdebantur, torquebantur, urebantur, laniabantur, trucidabantur, et multiplicabantur:” they were beaten, tortured, burned, torn, killed, and yet they were multiplied. Julian the apostate, learned this from persecution under Dioclesian, and upon that account he abstained for a time from exercising torments and bloody cruelties upon christians, because he saw that the christians by patient suffering were multiplied and became more glorious in the eyes of the people. Antichrist hath shed a great deal of precious blood, and the witnesses of the pure religion have been slain under him, yet hath the evangelical truth remained, and the witnesses, which were slain, have from time to lime revived and stood up in illustrious successors, who have held forth the same truth, and spoke in the same spirit and power, as those before them had done. When after the Parisian massacre there happened to be a great serenity in heaven, and a barberry-tree blossoming in a time unusual, some papists said, “That the thing was grateful to God, as if heaven and earth had rejoiced at it:” but the protestants took it as a sign, that the church should revive and flourish again, like the bush that burned, and was not consumed. The true church, which is founded in Christ’s blood, is not propagated or multiplied by martial arms, but by patient sufferings: this is the true way to do good to the church, and to continue the gospel among us; if we are indeed in a posture for suffering, and ready to seal up the truth with our blood, we may comfortly hope, that, whatever sufferings come, the gospel and gracious presence of God shall not finally depart from our nation.

3. Pious sufferers do give an evident token to the persecutor, that the wrath of God will come upon him. When the emperor Commodus was worshipping Jupiter, Vincentius, Eusebius, Peregrinus, and Potentianus, went about and exhorted the people to depart from the worship of devils, and honour the one only true God, lest they perished with Commodus; and soon after they suffered martyrdom for the same thing. Though all the martyrs did not in words warn the persecutors that the wrath of God would come upon them, yet they all by their patient suffering gave them an evident token of it. St. Paul exhorts the Philippians to patient suffering upon this account; “Stand fast,” saith he, “in one spirit, with one mind, striving together for the faith of the gospel, and in nothing terrified by your adversaries, which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God,” (Phil. 1:27, 28). The persecutor comes with his torments and engines of cruelty, to terrify the martyr; but the martyr, by his christian patience and courage, gives the persecutor an evident token that the wrath of God will come down upon him at last. If bloody persecutors, who look upon the suffering martyrs, had but their eyes open, they would see cause enough to reflect upon themselves, and say, Surely these men have a patience more than human, and therefore they suffer for God; and, if so, we in persecuting them fight against him, and may expect that his wrath should come down upon us, as it hath upon former persecutors. Herod Agrippa was eaten up of worms; Nero, with a trembling hand, cut his own throat; Trajan was thought to have poisoned himself; upon the persecution, in the time of Antoninus Verus, there followed wars, earthquakes, inundations, pestilences, as so many tokens of divine vengeance; Decius was slain, together with his children; Dioclesian died of fearful and miserable diseases; Julian, in the Persian war, was mortally wounded by an arrow from heaven, and threw up his blood thither with that horrible blasphemy, “Vicisti Galilæe;” Valens, in his war against the Goths, was wounded; and, flying into a cottage, was burnt with it by the enemy. The temporal judgments that nave befallen former persecutors, tell the after-ones what they may look for here in this world; or, if they might escape here, eternal vengeance will surely meet them hereafter. Our Saviour Christ will at the great day bid those that did not feed, clothe, and visit him, in his members, “Depart into everlasting fire,” (Matt. 25:41); much more will he say so to those that imprison, torment, and kill him in his members. When Henry the Second of France, in his running a tilt, received a fatal wound in his eye; he looked to the prison, where the poor protestants were shut up as captives for their religion, and often uttered these words: That he was afraid that he had done the poor innocent men wrong. Conscience then told him what it was to persecute. Oh! that such things as these might stop persecutors in their bloody ways, as the thunderbolt falling near the emperor Aurelianus did him in his intended persecution of the christians. The patience of those that suffer under their cruel bands, tell them that the wrath of God will fall upon them at last. I conclude with that of St Cyprian; “Quanto major persecutio, tanto gravior pro persecutione vindicta,” The greater the persecution is, the heavier will be the vengeance for it.

4. Pious sufferers are happy here and hereafter. They are happy here upon a double account.

1. They give the highest proof of their sincerity that can be given. Abraham gave a great proof of his sincerity in leaving his country, and a greater in offering up his only son, Isaac, at God’s command; but I take it, the martyr gives a higher proof of it than is done in either of those, it being more to part with all the world, than to part with our country; and to offer up ourselves to God, than to offer up a son. The highest proof of grace is in suffering. That faith must be right that endures the fiery furnace; that love must be pure, that practically lifts up God above all other things; that hope must be lively that lets go a present world for a future one; that obedience must be glorious that continues unto the death. The martyr hath a fair prospect, with a comfortable sight of his own uprightness; conscience gives an euge to his graces and sufferings; nay, the Holy Spirit is as a seal and earnest of his heavenly inheritance; “It bears witness with his spirit, that he is a son and heir of God.”

2. As they give the highest proof of their sincerity, so they have the gracious presence of God in the most eminent way with them. All his glorious attributes do, as it were, pitch their tents round about them, and put forth their virtues in a gracious manner for their good. His power rests upon them to bear them up, how weak soever, in the fiery trial; his wisdom directs them how to carry themselves under the cross; his mercy melts over them, while they are under man’s cruelty; his love is shed abroad in their heart while they bear the world’s hatred: the presence of God will be to them instead of, nay, infinitely more than all other comforts. They may say, “If God be for us, who can be against us, (Rom. 8:31). Why? Devils can, wicked men can; but Aquinas expounds the words, Quis contra nos læsive et prevalenter? “Who can be against us to hurt us and prevail over us?” That which is of God, cannot be overthrown; they may break out with St. Paul, in that gallant triumph, πέπεισμαι, “I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ.” (Rom. 8:38, 39). What St. Bernard saith of the church, is true of them, a noble part of it; Nec verbositate philosophorum, nec cavillationibus hæreticorum, nec gladiis persecutorum potuit illa separari à charitate Dei, quæ est in Christo: “They cannot be separated from the love of God in Christ, neither by the words of philosophers, nor by the cavils of heretics, nor yet by the swords of persecutors: God is in the midst of them, and they shall not be moved.”

Again: They are happy hereafter, and this stands in two things:

1. They are freed from all evils. In heaven they shall have no corruption within, nor oppression without; no noise of passion in the heart, nor rout of turbulent persecutors to disquiet them; the will of the flesh shall have a total circumcision; the infirmities of the body shall have a perfect cure; the serpent cannot hiss in paradise; no temptations or miseries can fasten on a saint in glory. There is day without night, love without fear, joy without sorrow, life without death, all happiness without the least mixture of evil. There the blessed martyrs shall be freed from all their troubles and miseries.

2. They are endowed with all good and happiness, The promises made to the overcomer in the Revelation of St. John, shall be made good to them; they shall eat of the tree of life in a blessed immortality; they shall have the white stone in a perfect absolution; they shall be clothed in robes of glory; they shall be pillars in the heavenly temple, standing there as ornaments in an immoveable felicity; they shall sit down with Christ in his throne, and judge their enemies that condemned them; they shall inherit all things; they that lost all for God shall inherit all in him who is goodness itself, and the fountain of it; they shall see him who is the original and crystal ocean of all truth; they shall enjoy Him who is the supreme good and sabbath of souls; they shall be swallowed up in the joy of infinite truth and goodness; and their happiness shall not be for a time, but run parallel with eternity itself; they shall be for ever in the Lord in the blessed region. There, as St. Austin hath it, God who is all in all, Sine fine videbitur, sine fastidio amabitur, sine fatigatione laudabitur: “Shall be seen without end, loved without disdain, and praised without weariness.” In the next world there will be a vast difference between persecutors and sufferers. The pride and cruelty of the one will be paid for in torments and endless misery in the prison of hell; and the patience and suffering of the other will be returned in joys and eternal felicity in the blessed heaven.
