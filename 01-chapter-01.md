# Chapter 1
*Persecution will come on good men—This world is mixed of comforts and sorrows—The old enmity will persecute—Corruption in saints will show itself inwardly and outwardly—The church is heir to the cross—God orders sufferings for good—Things abroad and at home admonish us.*

One apostle tells us, That all that will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution. Another acquaints us, That this is no strange thing; a third, wishes us not; to marvel at the world’s hatred. It is true, the sufferings of good men have been an old stumbling-block. Pompey complained, that providence was very dark: the poet was ready to think that there were no gods: nay, the holy Psalmist cried out, I have cleansed my heart in vain, as if religion were to no purpose: yet, if we consider all, those sufferings are not to be wondered at.

This world, standing between heaven and hell, must partake of both. Heaven is all comfort; hell is all misery: the middle world must have a mixture; here evil men may meet with comforts, and good men may meet with afflictions.

The old enmity between the seed of the serpent and the seed of the woman, will stir up persecution to the world’s end. “He that is born after the flesh, will persecute him that is born after the Spirit:” it is his nature and property to do so; a thing no more to be wondered at than the stinging of a serpent, or the tearing of a briar. Many pretences were made to palliate the persecution of the primitive christians. Under Trajan it was said, that the christians were too numerous; under Antoninus Pius it was given out, that all kinds of penal evils came for their sakes; under Severus it was alleged, that they were guilty of all kind of villanies; under Dioclesian it was fairly pretended, that there must be but one religion in the empire; but in truth, all these were but so many colours, the venom of the serpent was at the root; the devilish enmity, which is in carnal men against the saints, was the very proper cause of all those persecutions. Wickedness will proceed from the wicked; the old enmity will break out, and that not only in men grossly wicked, but in fair moralists, too. A Trajan or Antoninus can persecute, as well as a Nero: the same root of bitterness is in all carnal men.

The inherent corruption in the saints will shew itself inwardly and outwardly: inwardly it will raise up a prosecution in their own bosom; the flesh lusteth against the spirit. No sooner is the new creature born, but the indwelling sin doth hunt it as a partridge upon the mountains, and seeks the life of its infant graces, as Herod did the life of Christ in the cradle. And how can the saints wonder at a persecution without, when they have one within in their souls? Or how can they expect less than briars in the world, when they feel a thorn in their own flesh? Outwardly it will, even in saints, when let out, be injurious to others. A David, when his corruption breaks forth, can be inhuman towards the Ammonites; an Asa can imprison the Seer, and oppress the people. And if corruption may do so in a saint, in whom it is in part mortified, what may it not do in a son of Belial, in whom it is the total ruling principle? In the one, the regenerate part holds back; but in the other, the whole soul is carried out to wickedness. It is no wonder that such an one should persecute; his, principles are entirely for it.

The church is heir to the cross. Its suffering began from the blood of Abel, and hath continued ever since. Israel, God’s peculiar people, was first oppressed in Egypt, under cruel bondage; then vexed in Canaan by the neighbour nations round about them; afterwards carried captive into Babylon, and at last trod under foot by Antiochus Epiphanes. The christian church was first persecuted by the pagan emperors; then torn in pieces by Arians and other heretics; afterwards overrun with Goths and Vandals, and at last trod down by Mahomet and Antichrist. All along it hath been in a suffering condition, and it is no wonder, if it suffer on till it come to rest in heaven.

God orders the sufferings of the church for his own glory, and his people’s good. He orders them for his own glory; providence is admirable in preserving a suffering church. The ark floats upon the waters, and drowns not: the bush burns, and is not consumed the lily is among thorns, and withers not; the saints are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed. Strength comes forth out of weakness; light arises out of darkness; the bones, though sometimes dry and hopeless, live; the witnesses are slain, and revive again; pressures multiply the church, and sufferings propagate it; and what a sight is this? Who may think much at those sufferings, in which so much of God appears? Again, he orders them for his people’s good; the fan will purge away their vanity; the furnace will melt out their dross; every name of persecution will lift them up nearer to heaven; their sufferings will make them white; their graces will come forth as gold out of the fire in their pure lustre; the rod will blossom, and bring forth peaceable fruit of righteousness; the Holy Spirit will come down upon them in larger effusions of grace and comfort: and what things are these? Who can imagine those sufferings needless, which have so excellent an issue?

To conclude; Things abroad and at home admonish us: abroad, the Protestant religion runs very low; idolatry grows in the world, and where that goes before, cruelty follows after. The fiery furnace waits upon the idol: the scarlet whore, full of fornications, will drink the blood of saints; the false worshippers will persecute the true; the sighs and groans of the poor souls in France do alarm all that have any sense of piety or humanity: who can but mourn at such mourning providences? At home our sins are grown up to heaven; oaths, blasphemies, perjuries, hellish plots, uncleannesses, excesses, atheism, contempt of ordinances, deadness and formality in religion, unthankfulness and unfaithfulness to God, are found among us. The cloud of guilt, which hangs over our heads, is very black, and ready to come down in storms of wrath upon us. Sword, and plague, and fire, have already consumed us; and because we sin on with a stiff neck, hard heart, and impudent face, more judgments may be expected. Eliphas, seeing the wicked taking root, suddenly cursed his habitation, (Job 5:3). He that sees our aggravated sins, may easily foretell our sudden destruction.
