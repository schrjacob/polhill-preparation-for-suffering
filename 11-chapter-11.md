# Chapter XI

*The eighth direction for suffering is humility—A high fabric must have a low foundation—Humility hath such rays from God, as makes us very low in our own eyes; it is a capacity for larger effusions of grace, it subjects a man to all the pleasures of God; it causes him to depend upon God for support and comfort.*

The eighth direction is this, if we would be in a fit posture for suffering, we must labour after humility of mind. It is the direction of our Saviour to christians, “Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart,” (Matt. 11:29). St. Austin, upon those words, gives an excellent rule; “Cogitas magnam fabricam construere celsitudinis, de fundamento prius cogita humilitatis:” thou thinkest to build a great high fabric, but first think to make a low foundation: the higher the building is, the lower must be the foundation. If we would build our Christianity as high as suffering for religion, we had need lay a deep foundation in humility for it. Our Saviour Christ was not only a pattern of suffering, but of humility too: St. Peter tells us, that, “he suffered, leaving us an example,” (2 Peter 2:21). St. Paul tells us, how he came to suffer; he emptied himself, or made himself of no reputation, “he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, the death of the cross,” (Phil. 2:7, 8). He laid by his robes of majesty, and became, as it were, nothing, that he might suffer for us. If we would follow Christ in suffering, we must put off our ornaments, and lay by our proud plumes; we must empty ourselves of all our self-excellencies, and become vile; yea, nothing in our own eyes, that we may endure the trial. St. Paul was a great sufferer for Christ, but withal he was one of the humblest that ever lived: indeed, before his conversion he was a Saul, a proud persecutor; but after it he was a Paul, persecuted, and little in his own eyes. Athanasius, who suffered so much under the Arians, had this character given him by Nazianzen, that he was high in worth, and humble in heart. There are four things to be noted in humility; each of which tend to prepare us for suffering.

1. Humility dwells in an enlightened mind, and hath such rays from God, as make the heart, where it is, take up very low thoughts of itself. Of old the appearances of God in outward symbols of glory, made men lie very low before him. When Job heard the voice of the Lord out of the whirlwind, “he abhorred himself in dust and ashes,” (Job 42:6). When the prophet saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, he cried out, “Woe is me, I am undone,” (Isa. 6:5). When Daniel saw the vision of the bright shining man, “his comeliness was turned into corruption,” (Dan. 10:8). The noble man now hath not such outward appearances, but he hath an inward light of faith, and when he looks up to God, and reflects upon himself, it makes him go in fundum, into the centre of the earth, and there to see his own nothingness. I shall give a triple instance of this: when the humble man looks up to the glory and greatness of God, he reflects and communes with his heart after this manner; Oh! how high is God! his glory is above the heavens, his majesty is infinitely brighter than a thousand suns, the rays of it bid me go down and hide myself in the dust of my own vileness and nothingness; how great is he, that spans the heavens, weighs the mountains, and measures the seas in the hollow of his hand? To him all nations are but as a drop of the bucket, a dust of the balance; nay, less than nothing itself: and I, what am I? the drop of a drop, a piece of a dust, and much less than that which is less than nothing itself. Such thoughts as these do so abase and annihilate a man in his sense, that the great and glorious God may do anything with him; his own littleness will Keep him from murmuring under any cross or affliction that comes from the Most High. Again, when the humble man looks to the holiness of God, he speaks to his heart: God is very holy, he is perfect purity, without any spot, infinite light without any darkness at all; the glance of his pure eyes bids me go down into my spotted self, and there cover myself with the shame of that corruption, that is worse than nothing: the stars are not pure in his sight, and how can I be so? The glorious angels cover their faces, and cry to him, Holy, holy, holy; and what should worms do! What reason have I to cry out over myself, as the leper was to do, Unclean, unclean. The sense of this is so deeply humbling, that it disposes him that hath it to be willing to go into any furnace, which God orders for the melting out of his dross. The excellent martyr, Mr. Hooper, carried his humility with him to the fiery trial: there he prayed thus; “Lord, I am hell, but thou art heaven; I am a sink of sin, but thou art a gracious Redeemer:” the sense of his own imperfections made him lie very low. Moreover, when the humble man looks to the grace of God, he adores that pure self-moving fountain of all good; and withal, abases himself under his great unworthiness of the least drop of it: The evil that is in me, saith he, is my own; but all the good that is in me is entirely from grace. This taste of grace to a man’s unworthy self, admirably disposes him to bear the cross: such an one will argue with himself, Shall God give me grace and glory, and shall I not suffer for him? The suffering is not the hell I deserve, but that which is much less; and shall I not suffer? There is a glorious heaven to come after it, and why should I hang back? The words of Dr. Sclater are very remarkable; “God,” saith he, “rewards ultra condignum, afflicts citra condignum;” that persuasion who so carries, and is acquainted with his foul sins, willingly prays with Austin, “Hîc ure, hîc seca, ut in æternum parkas;” here burn, here cut me, that thou mayest spare for ever. Thus humility, by the rays that it hath from God, makes a man very vile in his own eyes, and so prepares him for the cross. The proud man, that thinks highly of himself, will murmur at anything; and the humble man, that thinks meanly of himself, will bear with anything.

2. Humility puts the soul into a capacity to have larger effusions of grace bestowed upon it; “God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble,” (James 4:6). God hath two hands; with the one, he casts down the proud that lift up themselves against him; with the other, he lifts up the humble that lie at his feet for mercy. Humility is not only a grace, but a capacity to receive more of it. He that goes to a river to take up water, puts the mouth of his vessel downward to do it; he that goes to God for grace, must put his mouth in the dust, and cry to have it, not for his worth’s sake, but for his spiritual poverty. A humble heart is, as Parisiensis calls it, a spiritual vacuum; and as nature doth not suffer a vacuum in bodies, but fills up the space one way or other, so grace doth not suffer a vacuum in spirits, but fills up the humble soul with fresh supplies of grace. St. Austin sets out this by a notable similitude, “The water that falls down from heaven upon the mountains, flows away; but the water that falls upon the valleys, stays there:” in like manner the divine grace, that distils from above, doth not rest upon high proud persons, but upon humble ones: God leaves the full souls, and fills the empty; abases the exalted, and exalts the abased: all other graces grow together with humility; the more humble we are, the more we have of God with us, the more we have of grace in us; and the more we have of these, the more we have of strength in the inner man, and the more we have of preparation for a day of trial. If we build so high as suffering for Christ, we must dig deep and lay the foundation low, that when the storm comes we may stand fast and unmoveable.

3. Humility makes a man freely to bow and subject himself to God in all things. This is a choice and excellent preparative for suffering; the same which our Saviour commends to weary and heavy-laden souls: “Take my yoke upon you and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart,” (Matt. 11:29). Christians are to take up a double yoke, the yoke of evangelical commands, and the yoke of the cross that accompanies them; in both subjection is requisite; in the one, subjection to Christ’s authority commanding; in the other, subjection to his providence ordering: and that christians may be subject to both, they must look to the great pattern, and learn meekness and humility from him. The heart of man naturally is a very proud belial thing, that will bear no yokes; it will not be under Christ, not under his righteous commands by obedience, nor under his afflicting providences by patience; it lifts up itself, and by a kind of blasphemy practically aspires to be above God himself. But when the divine grace hath melted the heart and made it humble, then it will bow down and take both yokes upon itself; it will become freely subject to God and all his holy pleasure. I say freely; a proud man may be bowed down under the pressure of an external calamity, but an humble man bows himself down by an internal principle of grace; in the one, the subjection is merely of necessity, in the other it is free and of choice. Humility makes a man lie at God’s foot, and say, “Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?” or, “What wilt thou have me to suffer?” “Let the word of God come (saith Baldasser, the German divine) and we will submit to it six hundred necks, if we had so many.” Let the cross come (saith the humble man), and I will submit to it. Humility is virtually all obedience and patience, it makes a man to be as a little child, ruleable by all the will of God; whether that will come forth in precepts or providences, humility will comply and bow down under it. The lowly in heart will do or be anything for God, therefore our Saviour promises rest to such as the gracious reward of their labours and sufferings. It is good council that St. Austin gives, Esto parvus in oculis tuis, ut sis magnus in oculis Dei; “Be thou little in thine own eyes, that thou mayest be great in God’s;” subjecting thyself to all his pleasure is the way to be exalted by him.

4. Humility causes a man to depend upon God for support and comfort in his sufferings. The proud person stands in the posture of the σταθεὶς πρὸς ἑαυτὸν, standing to himself, (Luke 18:11); he stands upon his own bottom, and thinks himself able by his own power to do or suffer anything as he pleases: but standing in his own presumption, it is very likely that he will fall off as soon as the trial comes. But it is otherwise with the humble man; he knows that he is weak in himself, and must be strong in God, and therefore he will not trust in his own power or will, but look up to God for support and comfort in the evil day. It is a notable passage of St. Austin, “Multos impedit à firmitate presumptio firmitatis, nemo a Deo fit firmus, nisi qui a seipso sentit infirmum:” A presumption of firmness hinders many from being firm; no man is made firm by God, but he that feels infirmity in himself. The story in the Marian persecution is very memorable! Mr. Sanders, the martyr, at first shewed much weakness and fear; but Dr. Pendleton said to him, “What, man, fear? I will see every drop of my grease melted before I forsake Christ and his truth!” But afterwards, Sanders triumphantly suffered, kissing the stake, and saying, “Welcome the cross of Christ!” but proud Pendleton turned papist. Unto this instance I shall add a more ancient one; Peter, a great apostle, fell, and denied his Lord; but among the primitive christians, women and little children suffered in a brave and heroical manner. The greatest christians may fall, by presuming upon themselves; the least may stand, by depending on the power of God: the poor in spirit would not be their own keepers, but would commit themselves unto God, (Ps. 10:14), as being safer in his hands than in their own. Humble souls, not being able to bear up their own weight, lean upon the Rock of Ages; and, having no rest in themselves, they acquiesce in the centre of souls. The feeble conies have their houses in the rocks, and the weak christians dwell in the secret of the Most High. Annas Burgus, a senator of Paris, suffered for the pure religion with that constancy, that many were curious to know what religion that was, for which he so patiently endured death; and one reason of his patience was his humble dependance upon God, which he expressed in that often repeated prayer at his death, “Deus mi, ne me derelinquas, ne ego te derelinquam;” O my God, leave me not, lest I leave thee! He knew that his strength was in God only. Oh let us labour to have a humble dependance upon God, that, when sufferings come, we may look and be supported, wait and renew strength, be nothing in ourselves, and have all in God. So we shall be safe and secure from anxious fears; dabitur in horâ, support and comfort will come in the time of need.
