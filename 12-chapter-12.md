# Chapter XII

*The ninth direction for suffering is active obedience to the will of God; it flows from a good and honest heart; it respects God’s will and glory; it makes us to grow up into Christ, and to be allied to him; it increases grace and spiritual strength; it obtains the gracious presence of God, and it is the way to heaven.*

The ninth direction is this: if we would be in a fit posture for suffering, we must labour after an active obedience to the will of God: to do in a right manner as he would have us to do. It is a notable saying of the rabbins, Marces præceptum præcepti; one precept is the reward of another. He that rightly observes one precept, shall have in the name of a reward such grace from God, as shall enable him to do another and a more difficult command. It is an excellent thing to inure ourselves to the doing of God’s will; obedience is the chain about the spouse’s neck, (Cant. 4:9), one link hangs upon another; one piece of obedience draws on another. Active obedience will prepare us for passive; the doing of God’s will, will dispose us for the suffering of it. The apostle prays for the Colossians first, “That, they might walk worthy of the Lord, unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work;” and then in the next verse, “That they might be strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness,” (Col 1:10, 11). Where we may observe, that a holy life goes before, and then suffering graces follow after. There are in obedience six things observable, each of which tends to prepare us for suffering.

1. True obedience flows from a good and an honest heart; nay, I may add, it flows from the Holy Spirit of God. It flows from a good and honest heart; many unprofitable hearers there are, but the good and honest heart brings forth fruit. It was a high character which the apostle gives to the Romans, That they had obeyed from the heart, that form of doctrine, which was delivered to them, or, as it is in the original, into which they were delivered, (Rom. 6:17). The gospel was not only delivered to them, but they were delivered, and, as it were, cast into the mould of it, and that was the reason that they obeyed from the heart. Nay, further, obedience flows from the Holy Spirit; it is a choice promise in the covenant, “I will put my Spirit into you, and cause you to walk in my statutes,” (Ezek. 36:27). Obedience being a mere supernatural act, comes from the Holy Spirit, as the prime cause thereof; a general concourse suffices not; there must be a peculiar motion and impulsion of the Spirit in it; which made Gerson say, That all spiritual life was founded in miraculo influentiæ divinæ, in the miracle of a divine influence. We see what are the principles and fountains of active obedience, and the very same will produce passive too. “The good and honest heart brings forth fruit with patience,” (Luke 8:15). The words, “with patience,” are very remarkable; the good and honest heart may meet with persecutions in the world, yet it would blossom and bring forth fruit in the midst thereof. “The righteous flourishes as the palm-tree,” (Psalm 92:12.) The palm-tree is a symbol of immortality, growing under its burden; and the righteous, who hath an immortal seed in him, flourishes under all the pressures of a persecuting world. Again, the Holy Spirit, which makes good men do God’s will, will enable them to suffer it too. St. Paul took pleasure in persecutions, because, when he was weak, then he was strong, (2 Cor. 12:10); that is, the Holy Spirit did strengthen his inward man to bear the cross. The Holy Spirit in the saints is a well of water, springing up to everlasting life, (John 4:14). The persecuting world would fain stop and dam it up; but in the midst of all oppositions it springs, and never leaves springing till the saints be in heaven; and before they come thither, it is, as St. Peter speaks,” A spirit of glory resting upon them,” (1 Pet. 4:14); it brings down some glimpses of heaven into their hearts, whilst they are suffering for religion.

2. True obedience hath a pure respect to God’s will and glory; it hath a pure respect to God’s will; it doth not do the commands of God upon a bye-account, as Jehu destroyed Ahab’s house; but it doth them intuitu voluntatis, because it is the will of God; it is that which sways and casts the balance in a good man’s heart and life. As in matters of faith he believes, because God hath said it; so in matters of practice he obeys, because God hath commanded it. Also it hath a pure respect to God’s glory; mens cujusque id est quisque; the man is as his mind is, and the mind is as his end is; an obedient person will not be a centre to himself, nor make God, the most excellent being, a medium to any other thing: his great design is, that God in all things may be glorified: his holiness is but to shine as a beam from the Holy One; his mercy is but as a little drop flowing from the divine ocean; his obedience is to tell the world that God is supreme; like his Saviour Christ, he seeks not his own glory, but his Father’s. Such an obedience as this, admirably disposes a man for suffering; he that doth some things because they are commanded, will take up the cross, too, because it is in a peculiar manner commanded in the gospel: the stamp of the divine authority is not only found upon the precepts of piety and justice, but upon that of patience, too: also, he that doth sincerely glorify God in other things, will, if occasion be, glorify him in pious sufferings: some honour may be done to God in other duties, but in no other thing is there such honour given to him as in bearing the cross; therein a man doth practically declare that he values God above all the world; and therefore the martyrs have, as the schoolmen tell us, a greater reward in heaven than others: others have the essential glory in the vision of God, but for the martyrs is reserved an aureola, a peculiar coronet to be added to their crown of glory, propter victoriam de mundo, for their victory over the world.

3. True obedience makes us to grow up into Christ the head, and to be of near alliance to him. It makes us to grow up into Christ the head, (Eph. 4:15). Obedience, being the exercise of all graces, brings us into a near union with Christ, and makes us more and more like to him: the more we act our love, meekness, mercy, goodness, or any grace, the more we are united to him and incorporated with him; nay, true obedience makes us to be of near alliance to him. When our Saviour was told that his mother and brethren stood without to see him, his answer was, “My mother and my brethren are those which hear the word of God, and do it,” (Luke 8:20, 21). St. Ambrose, upon these words, tells us, Religiosiores copulæ mentium quam corporum; the conjunction of minds is more sacred than that of bodies. The obedient christian is brother to Christ, being born of the same Holy Spirit in regeneration, of which he was conceived in his incarnation; nay, he is mother to Christ, bringing him forth in the exercise of holy graces; somewhat of the love, mercy, piety, meekness of Christ is still a coming forth from him. In both these respects, doth obedience dispose us to suffering; the more we grow up unto Christ, the head, the more divine power and virtue we have from him; our chief strength lies not in ourselves, but in our head; we may do, nay, and suffer anything, through him strengthening us; and the more we are allied to him, the more we are bound to adhere to him. Our supernatural birth obliges us to live to him, nay, and if need be, to die for him; and we are to bring him forth not only in other holy virtue, but in that of patience. St. Paul bore about in his body the dying of the Lord Jesus, (2 Cor. 4:10); and the allies of Christ must be ready, at God’s call, to suffer with him.

4. True obedience produces an increase of grace and spiritual strength. Obedience is a christian’s daily walk; the more he exercises himself to godliness, the more grace he hath in his soul. That faith, which was but as a little grain of mustard-seed, becomes a tree, spreading itself forth at last as high as assurance. That love, which was as a little spark raked up in the ashes, comes to be a vehement flame, aspiring after the fruition of God in heaven. That hope, which was but a poor weak thing in the soul, comes to have more liveliness and supernatural stature. The path of the just, which is in obedience, is as the shining light, “which shines more and more unto the perfect day in heaven,” (Prov. 4:18). The more a christian exercises himself in obedience, the stronger he grows in the inner man: of a plant, he comes to be a tree of righteousness; of a babe, he comes to be a man in Christ. His vital principles become more strong, his supernatural heat increased, he holds on his way of obedience, and so grows stronger and stronger, (Job 17:9). Such an obedience as this admirably disposes a man for suffering. The greater his stock of grace is, the better will he hold out in the straits of the world. The more strength he hath in the inner man, the more able he will be to bear the burden of the cross: “If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small,” (Prov. 24:10). Great strength will keep a man from fainting. When the children of Israel were come to be above six hundred thousand, (Num. 1:46), it was a great encouragement to make them go on gallantly against their enemies. And when christians have their graces multiplied, and among the rest patience comes to be all patience, as the expression is, (Col. 1:11), it gives them spirit and life to bear sufferings.

5. True obedience obtains the gracious presence of God to help and comfort good men in the doing his will. The rabbins say, That if two sit together conferring about the law, the shechinah is among them: I may say, if one single christian be a doing of God’s will, the divine presence is with him. Thus our Saviour saith; If any man love him, and keep his words, the Father and the Son will come and make their abode with such an one, (John 14:23). Such an one hath a shechinah in his heart; God will be there helping and comforting of him. Whilst he is a doing of God’s will, strength will come in, as it did to the Levites, (1 Chron. 15:26); and not only strength, but comfort too. In keeping his commands there is great reward; some of the oil of joy, which is upon Christ, the great doer of God’s will, drops down upon good men in their sincere obedience; they have an inward peace, and joy unspeakable. In this respect obedience prepares the heart of christians to endure suffering. An obedient christian can argue thus with himself; I have found God’s gracious presence strengthening and comforting me in the doing of his will, much more shall I have it when I come to suffer, and part with all for his sake. When all forsook St. Paul, yet the Lord stood with him, and strengthened him, (2 Tim. 4:16, 19). When Mr. Sanders was examined about his religion, he was wonderfully comforted, and received a taste of the communion of saints, a pleasant refreshing did issue from every part of his body to his heart, and from thence into all parts again. Cicely Ormes was filled with such joy and comfort, that at the kindling of the fire, she said, “My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my Spirit doth rejoice in God my Saviour.” O let us firmly conclude this with ourselves, that God will not leave or forsake his people, no, not at other times, much less will he do it in the time of fiery trials. Then they shall have strength and comfort in a more than ordinary way, enough to make them to triumph over their sufferings, or at leastwise to bear them with patience.

6. True obedience is the way to heaven: those blessed ones, that do the commands of God, “have right to the tree of life, and enter in through the gates into the city,” (Rev. 22:14). The more obedient a man is to the divine will, the richer entrance he hath into the blessed kingdom. After sowing to the Spirit comes the crop of eternal glory; after walking in holy obedience, comes the blessed end of life and immortality. In this respect, obedience fits us for sufferings: a man that is in the way to hell, is not capable of suffering; it is not imaginable that a man should bear reproach for Christ, who hath no hope of glory; or that he should part with his treasure here, who hath none in heaven; or that he should lay down his life temporal, who hath no right to an eternal one; or that he should let go his portion of good in this world, who hath none in another. But the obedient christian, who is in the way to heaven, is in a capacity to suffer any thing that meets him in the passage thither: reproaches may come, but he is going to shine in glory; worldly goods may be spoiled, but he hath an inheritance incorruptible that fadeth not away; temporal life may be lost, but in the very instant there begins an eternal one with the blessed God in heaven; he may by a persecution be justled out of this world, but he hath a better to go to, where there are crowns of glory, rivers of pleasures, plenitudes of joy, and all in the blessed God. Our Saviour Christ for “the joy that was set before him, endured the cross,” (Heb. 12:2). St. Paul would “finish his course that he might have the crown of righteousness,” (2 Tim. 4:7, 8). When the martyr Babylas suffered, he sung that of the Psalmist, “Return unto thy rest, O my soul;” his mind was upon the eternal sabbath in heaven. When Basil the great was threatened with banishment, and death, he was not at all moved at it: banishment is nothing to him that hath heaven for his country; neither is death any thing to one to whom it is the way to life: He that is in the way to heaven hath great reason to break through all difficulties to get thither.
