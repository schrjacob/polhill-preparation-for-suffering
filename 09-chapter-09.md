# Chapter IX

*The sixth direction for suffering, is a lively hope of eternal life—Hope assures us, that there is another world, that the good things of it exceed those of this, that we have an interest in them—Hope disposes us for them—Hope waits for them unto the end.*

The sixth direction is this: if we would be in a fit posture for suffering, we must get a lively hope of eternal life. As our life is a sea, hope is compared to an anchor, which makes us stand steady in a storm; as our life is a warfare, hope is compared to a helmet, which covers the soul in times of danger; as the body liveth spirando, by breathing, so the soul lives sperando, by hoping. A man cannot drown so long as his head is above water; hope lifts up the head, and looks up to the redemption and salvation that is to come in another world in its fulness and perfection. Hope doth three things; it assures good things to come; it disposes us for them; it waits for them unto the end: each of which will, be of singular use to fit us for pious sufferings.

1. Hope assures good things to come: it is called the hope of salvation, (Thes. 5:8); the hope of glory, (Rom. 5:2); the hope of eternal life, (Tit. 1:2), because it assures these things. To this I shall speak in three particulars.

1. Hope assures us that there is another world, called in scripture, The world to come: without this there can be no foundation for pious suffering; no man can freely part with this world unless he be assured of another. “If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable,” (1 Cor. 15:19). Miserable indeed, to be persecuted out of one world, and to have never another to go to. If christians were in as dark a case, as the emperor Adrian was, when dying he cried out, “O my poor soul, whither art thou going?” they could be in no rational capacity of suffering; but hope assures them, that there is another world, where things are administered in a different manner than they are here in this. Here good men bear the cross—there they wear the crown; here they are black with reproaches—there they shine as the sun; here they are tossed at sea—there they enter into rest; here they drink of the bitter cup—there of the rivers of pleasure above; here they are in the bloody hands of men—there in the arms of a gracious God. Hope is sure, that these things are so: God’s promises secure them; and, that we might have strong consolation, God’s oath is superadded also: our Saviour hath sealed up the truth of them with his own blood, and we may venture our dearest lives upon them. Hence it is, that hope is said to be the anchor of the soul, sure and steadfast, entering into that within the veil, (Heb. 6:19). Other anchors may break, but this will never fail; other anchors are fastened in this world, but this enters into that within the veil, and fixes itself in the unmoveable heaven; and in respect thereof, christians become in some measure unmoveable in the midst of all the storms here below. St. Cyprian saith of the Christians in his time, that their faith and hope did stand unmoveable and unshaken, inter ipsas seculi ruinas, among the ruins of the world. When the excelled Melancthon was threatened by his enemies, that they would not leave him a footstep in Germany, he replied, That he should have one in heaven: in like manner, when a poor persecuted Christian is ready to be cast out of this world, he may comfort himself with this, that he hath another to go to, where he shall have better usage, and a reward for his sufferings.

2. Hope assures us, that the good things of the world to come do incomparably exceed the things of this world. If the things of this world were the better, no man would leave better for worse: nay, if they were but equal, no man would part with that in possession for that in expectation: but hope assures us that the good things of the world to come do far transcend those that are in this world. The mansions in glory are better than the houses of clay; the incorruptible inheritance exceeds a fading one; eternal life is much more precious than temporal; the crowns of immortality above outshine all the titles of honor here below; the pure rivers of pleasure in heaven are far sweeter than the delights on earth; the fruition of God (who is the supreme good, centre of souls, Sabbath of rest, and fountain of blessedness,) cannot but be infinitely beyond the enjoyment of creatures. A good assurance, that these things are so, will dispose us to part with the lesser concerns here below, that we may enjoy the greater that are above. We read of some worthies that took joyfully the spoiling of their goods, because they had in heaven a better and enduring substance. (Heb. 10:34.) And again, of some, that would not accept deliverance, because they would obtain a better resurrection. (Heb. 11:35.) Shadows and trifles were to be parted with, rather than massy and durable felicity; the bubble or vapour of a transitory life was to be let go, rather than an everlasting one. When in the persecution under Dioclesian, the martyrs were asked, What made them bear such torments; and what they expected after all their sufferings? They made this answer: That they did hope for those good things which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, which God hath prepared for them that love him. We see what bore up their spirits in their sufferings; let us labour to have a high sense of the excellencies of the world to come, that, if need be, we may part with all for it.

3. Hope assures our interest in the good things of the world to come: and here two things are to be noted; the one is this, hope, in its initial existence assures our interest in them fundamentally; he that hath a true lively hope of them hath a real interest in them; every right grace touches upon heaven, and gives a right to it; but hope doth it in a kind of peculiar way; it enters in within the veil, and in a sort takes possession of the other world. As the ship is at land in its anchor, so the soul is in heaven in its hope; and he that hath a true interest there will not part with it in a time of suffering: the anchor being in heaven, and fastened in the unmoveable felicity there, will hold out in a storm. Such an one will reckon, as St. Paul did, that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. (Rom. 8:18.) Or, if a comparison be made, the sufferings in respect of the glory, will be but as a drop of wormwood, to a vast sea of infinite sweetness. The other thing is this: hope in its full stature assures our interest in the good things to come sensibly; he that hath a plerophory of hope, certainly knows that he hath an interest in them. “We know that we have passed from death to life,” saith St. John. (1 John 3:14.) As if the apostle had said, we are in the borders of heaven, and we know it, as it were, sensibly, as we do our passage from one place to another. Holy Job saith, “I know that my Redeemer liveth; and, maugre all the worms, in my flesh I shall see God.” (Job 19:25, 26.) He was sure of the bliss-making vision, and could look through the dust to immortality. Such a full hope ushers in a kind of paradise into the soul, and admirably fits it to bear sufferings; the internal suavity is able to sweeten any outward condition. The learned Rivet, at his dying hour, broke forth into these words: Expecto, credo, persevero, dimoveri nequeo, Dei spiritus meo spiritui testatur, me esse ex filiis suis, rem ineffabilem! I expect, believe, persevere, cannot be moved; God’s spirit witnesses to mine, that I am one of his children; O ineffable love! Let us labour to have, not only a lively hope, that we may have a title to heaven, but a full hope that we may know our title to it. This will be a high cordial in an evil day, and make us able, whatever the sufferings be, to go on triumphantly and with full sails to heaven.

2. Hope doth not only assure the good things to come, but disposes us for them. Hope is not an idle dream or notion, but it is an active and lively thing; it doth not merely look to the glory above, but puts the soul into a posture for it; every one, that hath in him the nope of so great a thing as the seeing the blessed God is, purifieth himself, even as he is pure, (1 John 3:3). He knows darkness cannot have communion with light; unclean eyes cannot be opened in so pure a place as heaven is; the earthly heart is too gross to be in the region of holy spirits; he that drowns himself in sensual pleasures is not meet to drink of the pure rivers that are above. Malicious spirits cannot be capable of dwelling there, where infinite love opens itself in all its sweetness. The false-hearted hypocrite can never be admitted to see truth in the original, nor the evil man to drink goodness at the fountain-head. He, therefore, that hath a right hope of being with God in heaven, will purify himself for such a high estate; he will labour to have more of the light of faith to fit him for that of vision; to have more purity of heart, to make him meet to see the Holy One; to have more of heaven in his affections, to prepare him for that blessed region; to have more spiritual delight here, that he may be capable of entering into the joy of his Lord hereafter; to have his heart more filled with holy love, that he may be in an apt posture for the rich effusions of love in heaven; to have more truth and goodness in his heart, that he may be the more ready to enjoy the fountain and fullness of both, I mean, the blessed God, who is all in all. Thus this lively hope makes a man meet for heaven, and in so doing, it makes him meet for those sufferings that lie in his way thither. That purity, which disposes him to enjoy God in heaven, doth also dispose him to suffer for him on earth; and the greater disposition is to heaven, the centre of blessedness, the stronger will the motion be to break through all difficulties that are in the passage thereunto. Let us therefore get a purifying hope, that we may be fit for the cross.

3. Hope doth not only dispose us for the good things to come, but it waits for them unto the end. Hope is a waiting grace, it makes a christian’s life to be a perpetual waiting: “All the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come,” saith Job, (chap. 14:14). Job had many changes, but he waited for that great one, which should bring him into a state of unchangeable happiness. Whatever holy men are a doing, still they are in a waiting posture. When Jacob was blessing his sons, he did not forget this, but broke out in a sudden sweet ejaculation, “I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord!” (Gen. 49:18). Hope makes christians to wait for the good things to come at all times, but in a special manner in time of sufferings: St. Paul, speaking first of the suffering saints, and then of the groaning world, expresseth himself thus; “We ourselves also, which have the first-fruits of the Spirit, groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body, for we are saved by hope,” (Rom. 8:23, 24). Here we may observe the true state and posture of the saints; afflictions make them groan, but the divine hope, the first-fruits of the Spirit, make them wait for a better world, in which adoption and redemption shall have their complete perfection: a christian in afflictions being tormented in this world, will wait for a better. The martyr Agatha, having her breasts cruelly cut off for religion, told the persecutor, That yet she had two breasts remaining, such as he could not touch; the one of faith, the other of hope; which afforded her great comforts in her torments. Faith adheres to the promise, hope waits for the good things promised; both strengthen in a day of trial. It is the very nature of divine hope to wait for the good things to come: when the sun of prosperity shines, it waits in a way of obedience; “Lord, I have hoped for thy salvation, and do thy commandments,” saith David, (Ps. 119:166). He waited in a way of obedience to God’s commands. And when the storm of persecution comes, it waits in a way of patience. Hence the apostle speaks of the patience of hope, (1 Thess. 1:3). That hope, which in prosperity waited in a way of obedience, will in adversity wait in a way of patience: hope would have the christian to be always waiting for the upper world; but when the cross comes, it presseth upon him more vehemently, and will speak after this manner to him; What, hast thou waited for the great reward in heaven in duties and ordinances, and wilt thou not wait for it in sufferings, too? Heaven is the same still, and sufferings are not worthy to be compared with it: do but suffer a little, and thou shalt be there. When the martyr Ananias, in the Persian persecution, seemed to tremble at the approaching cross, Pusices spake thus to him; “Paulisper, O senex, oculos claude, nam statim lumen Dei videbis;” shut thine eyes a little, O old man, and immediately thou shalt see the light of God. Excellent is that of the apostle; “Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal,” (2 Cor. 4:17, 18). Here it is observable, affliction is light and momentary, but glory is a weight and eternal, there is no proportion between them: if by hope we look at the invisible and eternal things, his will support our hearts, that it is but a little short suffering, and we shall be in heavenly bliss for ever: let us therefore labour after a waiting hope, that we may patiently bear the cross.
