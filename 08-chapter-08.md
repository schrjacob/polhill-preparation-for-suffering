# Chapter VIII

*The fifth direction for suffering, is love to God and Christ. Love to God; such as value him, desire him, delight in him, and will and endeavour to serve and honour him—Love to Christ, such as value him, desire him, delight in him, and will and endeavour to serve and honour him.*

The fifth direction is this; If we would be in a fit posture for suffering, we must get a sincere love to God and Christ. St. Austin saith, “That two loves made two cities; the love of self made the earthly city, the love of God makes the heavenly one; the persecutor dwells in the one, and the martyr in the other.” There is an assimilating efficacy in love whereby it casts the mind into the mould of the thing beloved; If thou love earth, thou art earthy; if thou love God, thou art partaker of the divine nature, and dost resemble God himself. The greatest impediment to pious suffering is the love of the world and self; and the greatest preparative to it is the love of God and Christ. I shall first speak of love to God, as a preparative thereunto; and then of love to Christ as such.

1. Love to God is a preparative to suffering: if we love him above all things, no outward object will draw us from him; if we love him with all the heart, no inward lust will make us fall from him. Love to him stands in four things; each of which will dispose us to suffer for him.

1. Love to him stands in a high valuation of him; it esteems him to be such an one as he is set forth in scripture: to be the only wise God, the only Potentate, the only One that is good; to be all these essentially, fontally, super eminently. He that hath such an estimate of him will be ready to suffer for him: to such an one it is folly to leave the only wise, weakness to leave the only potentate, misery to leave the only good; and how can he leave so excellent an object? To such an one it is prudence to adhere to the only wise, strength to adhere to the only potentate, happiness to adhere to the only good; and how can he choose but adhere to him? It was the saying of an ancient, “Tum dignè Deum æstimamus cum inæstimabilem dicimus;” then we rightly esteem God, when we account him inestimable. Estates, bodies, lives may be valued, but he is infinitely beyond all estimation: all creatures are but as shadows and little drops of being, in comparison of him; it is a just debt we owe to him to rate him incomparably above all things; and in so doing, the soul itself is ennobled and made fit to suffer for him, as a man, by valuing the world above itself becomes base and brutish, and like the beasts that perish; so a man, by estimating God above all things, becomes heroical and divine, and like the angels, that live altogether upon him: such an one is able to part with life in the channel, to have it in the fountain; to let go all other things, to have all in the one all-sufficient God.

2. Love to God stands in holy desires after him; it makes the soul pant after him, as the hart panteth after the water-brooks, and go out of itself in holy anhelations after union with him: such is the heavenly property of it, that it aspires to be one spirit with him, to have idem velle, and idem nolle, to will as he wills, and nill as he nills; and when once our wills are melted into his, everything that comes from him will be welcome to us. Though flesh and blood may cry out of suffering as a very hard thing, yet love will say that nothing can be wiser or better than that which our Father orders and lays out for us. If desire after God as the supreme good once put our souls into motion, we shall follow him not into ordinances only, but into sufferings also: his gracious presence is in both; in ordinances it is in a good measure, but in sufferings, which are the highest services on earth, it is in a more eminent manner. God doth not barely say to his afflicted people, “I am with thee!” but, “I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness,” (Isa. 41:10); many words are heaped up together to import the excellency of his presence with them. O let our hearts burn within us with ardent desires after him, that we may be able to bear the fiery trial at its coming.

3. Love to God stands in a holy complacence in him; it makes the soul rest upon him as Noah’s dove did upon the ark, and centre in him as in the supreme good. Holy desires end in inward satisfaction; David, thirsting after God, comes to have his soul satisfied as with marrow and fatness, (Ps. 63:5). And christians that breathe after him come to have sweet spiritual joys and delights, tastes of heaven, and drops from the pure rivers of pleasures that are above: these are able to sweeten the bitterest sufferings. It is said of the Thessalonians, that “They received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost,” (1 Thess. 1:6). The gospel doth not go alone, but affliction accompanies it; neither will affliction go down alone, but the joy of the Holy Ghost sweetens it: the blessed martyrs have experimentally found these divine joys in their hearts. It is said of Alexander the martyr, famous for his love to God, that ne ingemuit, he did not so much as fetch a groan in the midst of his torments; and doubtless he had strong consolations within, to bear him up in his sufferings. The martyr Algerius being in prison, wrote thus: In the dark dungeon I find a paradise of pleasure; in a place of sorrow dwells tranquillity; in an infernal cave I have joy of soul: O, how good is the Lord! How easy and sweet his yoke! Such heavenly cordials will bear up christians in the greatest trials. O let us labour to delight our souls in God, that we may be able to suffer for him.

4. Love to God stands in a holy benevolence towards him; it delivers and surrenders up the whole man to him; it wills and endeavours, so far as a poor creature can to an infinite Creator, to bring all service and glory to him. Thus the twenty-four elders fell down before him and cast down their crowns, saying, “Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honour, and power,” (Rev. 4:10, 11); renouncing themselves, they refer all that they have and are, to him alone: this is an excellent preparative to suffering. If we would indeed serve him, we must be willing to suffer for him; for that is the highest service that can be done to him on earth; if we would indeed glorify him, we must be ready to suffer for him; for that is the greatest glory that we can possibly give unto him; therein we do practically declare to all the world, that God is our all, riches, honours, relations, life itself, are as nothing to him. Oh, let us labour to surrender up ourselves to him in other things, that we may not fail to make the greatest surrender of all in suffering.

2. Love to Christ is a preparative to suffering: Ignatius, (whose motto was, amor meus crucifixus, my love was crucified) would suffer any thing for Christ. The martyr Felicitas was so in love with Christ, that she would not only suffer herself, but have her seven sons suffer for him also. Love to Christ stands in four things, each of which will dispose us to suffer for him.

1. Love to Christ stands in a high valuation of him; it esteems him altogether precious: precious in his person, being Immanuel, God and man in one; precious in his atoning sufferings, which (being by his deity elevated into a kind of infinity) were enough to pay for the sin of a world; precious in his holy words; his mysteries being heights, his commands rectitude, his promises grace: precious in the rich treasures of grace, which are in him, and ever flowing out towards believers: he that thus esteems of him will be ready to suffer for him. To leave his atoning sufferings is to run into hell; to leave his words is to run into all error; to leave his treasures of grace is to run into spiritual poverty: and how can we leave him? To adhere to his atonement, is peace and comfort; to adhere to his words, is to keep the way of life; to adhere to his treasures of grace, is to have continual influences of grace from him: and how can we choose but adhere to him? St. Paul counted all things dross and dung for him, (Phil. 3:8); St. Cyprian, in his exhortation to martyrdom, gives this as one rule, that we should, nihil Christo præponere, prefer nothing before Christ. To esteem any thing better than him, is the way to turn apostate; but to esteem him better than all, is the way to stand in a day of trial.

2. Love to Christ stands in holy desires after him, it causes a man to long and faint for him, and, as one in extremity, to cry out, Give me Christ, or else I die: without the laver of his blood, I die in my sins; without the supplies of his grace, I die in my wants: Oh! that I may have him! The spouse in the Canticles was sick of love, languishing and ready to fall into a spiritual swoon with her passionate desires after him and his gracious presence; nothing in all the world could cure or satisfy her, but his all-desirable self. That soul that truly desireth Christ, doth not desire, aliud præter illum, aliud tanquam illum, aliud post illum; any thing besides him, any thing equally to him, any thing after him. Such an ardour and holy flame of love, as this is, is an extatical thing; it makes a man go out of himself to seek after him; it will sell all for him, and, like those virgin souls, (Rev. 14:4), follow him whithersoever he goeth; not only into the banqueting-house of ordinances, but into sufferings and afflictions for him. The martyr Gordius had such an ardent love to Christ, that he was ready to suffer, mille mortes, a thousand deaths for the name of Jesus Christ. Oh, let us labour to have our hearts kindled and inflamed with holy desires after him, that we may be able to stand and endure the fiery trial.

3. Love to Christ stands in an holy complacence in him, it makes the soul enjoy a kind of heaven in his presence, and delight itself in his satisfying sweetness. The spouse in the Canticles was ravished, and, as it were, swallowed up in him; the savour of his sweet ointments lay upon her heart; his love was better to her than all the wine of the world; she sat under the broad shadow of his merits with great delight, pardons and graces dropping down from the tree of life upon her; he is in her eyes. tota desideria, all loves or desires; every thing in him hath a divine sweetness in it. This spiritual joy and delight in Christ our Saviour, is an excellent preparative in order to suffering: the church will have him lie all night “between her breasts,” (Cant. 1:13); all night, that is in times of fear and temptation, that his presence may sweeten the bitterest condition to her. The cross of Jesus, if we taste the sweetness of it, will turn a marah into joy and comfort: “Tua præsentia, Domine, laurentio ipsam craticulam dulcem fecit;” thy presence, O Lord, made the tormenting gridiron sweet to St. Lawrence, saith an ancient. Philip, Lantgrave of Hesse, being a long time prisoner under Charles the Fifth, felt the divine consolations of martyrs supporting him. O let us labour to taste more of the sweetness of Christ, to find his blood in every pardon, his Spirit in every grace, his wine cellar in every ordinance, that the divine comforts, that we experimentally feel in him, may sweeten the cross to us.

4. Love to Christ stands in a holy benevolence towards him; it surrenders up the whole man to him; it endeavours to serve and honour him to the utmost. Thus those many thousands cry out, “Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing, (Rev. 5:11, 12); they give all to Christ. This is an excellent preparative for suffering. If we would serve him in other things, we must serve him in suffering for him; if we would honour him in obedience to other commands, we must honour him in taking up the cross too. St. Paul desired that Christ might be magnified in his body, whether it were by life or by death, (Phil 1:20). If he lived he would magnify Christ by active obedience; and if he died, he would do it by passive: either way he would have Christ glorified in him. The martyr, Romanus, having a multitude of wounds in his body, thanked the persecutor for opening so many mouths to glorify Christ. In nothing is Christ so much glorified as in his suffering saints; therein they demonstrate the highest love, seal up the evangelical truths with their own blood; practically prefer Christ before all the world, and offer up themselves for him who gave himself a sacrifice for them. O let us labour to make a total resignation of ourselves to him, that if sufferings come, we may be able to bear them for his sake.
