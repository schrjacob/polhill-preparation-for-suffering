# Chapter VII

*The fourth direction for suffering is precious faith—This hath a triple respect; a respect to God, his providence, power, and grace—A respect to Christ, as a propitiation, a pattern, a head, and helper—A respect to the promises; the promises of God’s presence, the promises of confirmation, the promises of a good issue.*

The fourth direction is this, if we would be in a fit posture for suffering, we must labor after a precious faith; a dogmatical faith will not do it; the devil himself, who is the chief agent in persecution, hath such a faith; neither will a temporary faith do it, this is but a mere blossom, that falls off in a storm of persecution; it must be a precious faith, a furnace faith, that will endure the fiery trial. This is the apostle’s θυρεὸς, shield like a door, broad enough to cover the soul and all its graces, (Eph. 6:16); this is to be taken above all other pieces of spiritual armor; it is eminent among the graces as the sun is among the planets; it is the great conquering grace; all other graces act in conjunction with it. In the eleventh chapter to the Hebrews, styled by some the little book of martyrs, the saints are brought in doing and suffering great things, but all is ascribed to faith, as the captain-grace of all the rest, the first mover to other graces; it works by love, and not only so, but by meekness, obedience, patience, running like blood and spirits in every part of the new creature. Faith hath a triple respect, to God, to Christ, to the promises, and in each of these it is of singular use in order to sufferings.

1. Faith hath a respect to God; it makes its approaches to him, nay, it fixes the soul in him as in its center. Hence it is that the “righteous fears no evil tidings, because his heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord,” (Psalm 112:7). The world rolls about, but he by faith stands fast in the unmoveable God. Hence it is that the church becomes unmoveable too. “God is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved,” (Psalm 46:5). There are three things in God which faith fixes upon in order to pious suffering.

1. Faith fixes upon his providence. The Stoic could say, that there was no living in a world empty of God and providence. Much more may the Christian that is tossed up and down in a persecuting world say so. But his faith tells him that persecution comes not by chance, man rages, but God reigns. The world is as a tempestuous sea, but God sits at the stern and governs all. He limits the fury of persecutors; the wrath of man shall praise him; the remainder of wrath, (or, as it is in the original,) the remainder of wraths he will restrain. (Psalm 76:10.) He lets out wrath in the singular number, and restrains wraths in the plural; nothing of it comes forth but what is permitted: nothing of it is permitted but the minor part only. He it is that orders the sufferings of the saints: Sense indeed sees only the outward confusion, but faith knows that there is a line, a divine order in it: sense looks at the wicked hands that are red with the blood of innocents, but faith looks at the holy hand that is in it: this is one thing that bears up good men, that their Father in heaven disposes of all. When Attila called himself flagellum Dei, the scourge of God, Lupus bid him come and do as he pleased. When Christians by faith look on persecutors as the rod and staff in God’s hand, they are ready to subject themselves to the cross. “It is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well-doing, than for evil doing.” (1 Pet. 3:17.) That interposed phrase (if the will of God be so) is very remarkable to believers: were there nothing in their sufferings but the will of bloody men, they would bear them more hardly and unwillingly; but because the will of the good God is there, they endure them more easily and freely than otherwise they would do: they know very well that God will turn all to good; his ends are far other than those of Satan and his instruments. Our Savior tells the church of Smyrna, that the devil should cast some of them into prison, that they might be tried. (Rev. 2:10.) In which words, it is to be observed, that God’s end is joined unto Satan’s act: Satan would have them in chains, but God would try them that their graces might come forth as gold out of the fire. The Assyrian monarch meant to cut off nations not a few, (Isa. 10:7); but God meant to chastise his people, and then to burn the rod. (Ver. 12 and 17.) He, that by faith can see the holy land and ends of God in persecution, will be ready to suffer under it.

2. Faith fixes upon his power. When Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were threatened with a fiery furnace for not worshipping the golden image, their answer was, “Our God is able to deliver us.” (Dan. 3:17.) Persecutors may be strong, but faith assures the soul that God is much stronger, and can deliver his people; nay, and will do it also; not, as those three worthies were, in a visible manner, yet in an invisible one: suffering saints have ever found by experience that the power of God hath bore them up in their sufferings. When Cœlocerius, in the persecution under the Emperor Adrian, saw the supports and patience that Faustina and Jobita had in their sufferings for Christ, he cried out, Vere magnus Deus Christianorum; the God of the Christians is truly great. When Justin Martyr saw the martyrs cheerfully dying for their religion, he thereupon fell off from Plato’s school to Christ: St. Paul, the great experienced sufferer, exhorts Timothy to be partaker of the afflictions of the gospel, according to the power of God, (2 Tim. 1:8,) that is, he should suffer not in his own power, but in God’s. Think thus with thyself, O Christian, God can and will give such internal supports and comforts as shall more than counterpoise all thy sufferings for him: fix thy faith upon his power, and thou canst not fail in the trial.

3. Faith fixes upon his grace and mercy; men are cruel, but God is gracious and merciful to his people at all times, but especially in a time of trial. He chooses them in the furnace of affliction, (Isai. 48:10). When men reprobate them as the off-scouring of all things, then God doth as it were choose them afresh; I mean, his electing love, which was in his heart towards them, as early as eternity itself, doth then break out in fresh acts of grace towards them. St. Paul tells the Philippians, That it was freely given to them in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but to suffer for his sake, (Phil. 1:29). Faith, which is the first gift, and suffering, which is the last in this life, do both issue out from the fountain of grace. Cast thyself, O Christian, upon the grace and mercy of thy good God; that grace, which calls, justifies, sanctifies thee, will also give thee the gift of suffering; that mercy, which spares thee in thy ordinary duties, will, in a time of suffering, be indulgent over thee in a more than ordinary manner. The mercy of God will be upon us according as we trust in him: the sweetest strains of mercy are reserved for the highest acts of faith, which are seen more in sufferings than in other things. If we carry faith with us into prisons and fiery furnaces, goodness and mercy will follow us thither in an eminent way. Faith hath a respect to Christ, it comes to him as to a center of rest, receives him as a precious gift, leans on him as a sure foundation; nay, ἰδιοποιέομαι, it individuates and appropriates him to the soul. There are three things in Christ which faith looks to in order to suffering.

1. Faith looks to him as a propitiation: it hides in his wounds, as in the clefts of the rock; it washes the soul in that atoning blood that cleanses from all sin; hereby the Christian is so strengthened in the inner man, that he can glory in tribulations, (Rom. 5:3). The world persecutes, but he hath peace with God; man hates, but he hath the love of God in his heart; sufferings may come, but they fall only upon the outward man; there is no sting within, nor guilt pressing upon conscience. When Luther was in fear of an apoplexy, he cried out, Feri, Domine, feri, paratus sum, quia à peccatis absolutus; strike, Lord, strike, I am ready, because absolved from sin. A Christian, that is washed from sin in the blood of Jesus, may bear the persecuting stroke; he hath refrigerium Christi, a sweet refreshment from Christ’s atonement, in that inward peace which is made by it in conscience.

2. Faith looks to Christ as a pattern. He is not only a propitiation to be trusted in, but a pattern to be imitated by us. “He suffered for us, leaving us an example, that we should follow his steps,” (1 Pet. 2:21). Whom should we follow, but our Lord and Savior? How can we spare our own blood, if we be washed in his? He drank up the bitter cup to the bottom, and shall we not take some drops of it? He bore the wrath of God for us, and shall we not bear the wrath of man for him? He learned obedience by the things which he suffered, and how much more should we poor creatures do so? He entered by suffering into glory; and why should we dream of another way thither? If we would be ready to suffer, let us look unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame: let us consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest we be weary and faint in our minds, (Heb. 12:2, 3). The noble Alzearius, being asked how he could so patiently bear injuries, answered thus: Converto me ad injurias Christi, I turn me to the injuries done to my Savior. We must look to Christ’s cross, that we may bear our own, it being now, no longer mere suffering, but sanctified by the sufferings of our Savior.

3. Faith looks to Christ as a head and helper. He is not a mere pattern, but a head and helper too. Were there no other supporting grace for the saints but that little in their own bosom, they might expect to fail in the trial; but there is an inexhaustible fountain of grace in their head in heaven, and that will bear them up in all their sufferings. This made St. Paul glory in persecutions, because the power of Christ would rest upon him; and when he was weak in himself, he was strong in that, (2 Cor. 12:9, 10). St. Cyprian, speaking of Christ in the martyrs, saith, Qui pro nobis mortem semel vicit, semper vincit in nobis; he that once overcame death for us, always overcomes it in us. This the martyr Blandina, though weak in body, found by experience; being bore up in the midst of torments by the power of Christ, and finding a fresh refreshment, as often as she said, Christiana sum, I am a Christian. The same was seen in the Martyr Sanctus, who bore various torments above all human strength, because he was bedewed and confirmed out of the celestial fountain of living water flowing down from Christ. Whatever thou doest, O Christian, be sure to apply thyself by faith unto the never-failing fountain of grace in him, that thou mayest have such supplies of grace, as may bear thee up in an evil day.

3. Faith hath a respect to the promises; these are the breasts of consolation, the channels in which the grace in God’s heart flows down to the sons of men: here the Christian may provide himself with cordials against the time of suffering. I shall here only mention three kinds of promises, for faith to live upon in a day of trial.

1. Faith must live upon the promises of God’s gracious presence: God tells his people, “That he will be with them in the fire and in the water,” (Isai. 43:2); that is, in all danger and calamities whatsoever; neither shall this presence be for a little time only, but constant and perpetual. “He will never leave them, nor forsake them,” (Heb. 13:5). This is a choice comfort to good men, that in tribulations they are not left alone, but God is with them. St. Paul had experience of this: “All men forsook him, but God stood with him and strengthened him,” (2 Tim. 4:16, 17). The presence of God was to him more than a world, and able to support him against all his adversaries. St. Cyprian, speaking of the martyrs in his time, saith, That God was not a mere spectator in their sufferings, but ipse luctatur in nobis, ipse congreditur, ipse in certamine coronat, pariter et coronatur; he strives in us, he encounters our adversaries, he crowns us in the battle, and is himself crowned therein. Let us, therefore, by faith rest upon the promise of God’s presence, and assure our hearts that he will be with us in our suffering. All the promises of God are yea and amen in Christ; and his being Immanuel, God with us, in the human nature, is a pledge to the saints, that God will be with them in their sufferings for him.

2. Faith must live upon the promises of confirmation. The apostle tells the Corinthians, “That God shall confirm them unto the end;” and adds this as a reason, “God is faithful, by whom ye are called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord,” (1 Cor. 1:29). God doth, as it were, pawn his faithfulness upon it, that they being once brought into union with Christ, shall never fall off, but be confirmed unto the end: “The gates of hell shall never prevail against them; they shall be kept through faith unto salvation;” nay, and their faith shall be kept too. Christ did not only pray for Peter, that his faith fail not, but he prays so for all the faithful. Oh! how comfortable are such promises to the saints! Let us by faith lay up these rich cordials in our hearts to keep up from fainting in persecution.

3. Faith must live upon the promises of a good issue: “All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth to his people,” (Ps. 23:6). “All things shall work together for their good,” (Rom. 8:28); persecutions and all. God alters the property of his people’s afflictions, and by an almighty alchemy turns dross into gold; he makes persecution turn to the refining of the saints, graces, and to the glorifying of his own great name. O! what great good things doth he bring out of evil! How much of his love and faithfulness may be seen in the cross! Let us, therefore, fix our hearts upon such promises, that, passing through the fiery trial, we may see the good end the Lord makes of it.
