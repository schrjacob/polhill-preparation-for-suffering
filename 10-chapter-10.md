# Chapter X

*The seventh direction for suffering is holy fear; not the fear of man, but of God; not a diffidential fear, but a fiducial one; not a servile fear, but a filial one—Holy fear looks at sin more than at suffering; at sufferings in hell more than at those on earth; at spiritual and eternal losses more than at carnal and temporal.*

The seventh direction is this, if we would be in a fit posture for suffering, we must get an holy fear in our hearts. The wise Solomon begins his Proverbs with this; “The fear of the Lord is the beginning (or head) of knowledge,” (Prov. 1:7); and ends his Ecclesiastes with this, “That to fear God, and keep his commandments, is the whole duty of man,” (Eccl. 12:13). Other things appertain to the beast, or the devil; but holy fear is the all of man, it makes him a perfect man, not only to do God’s will, but to suffer under it. In speaking to this, I shall first consider what that fear is which prepares us for suffering, and then how it prepares us thereunto.

1. I shall consider what that fear is which prepares us for suffering; and this I shall dispatch in three things.

It is not the fear of man but of God, that doth it. It is not the fear of man that can do it. God gives us a charge against this, “Who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die?” (Isa. 51:12). There is no cause to fear a weak piece of clay, a very breath, a fading leaf; he must die, and there is an end of him and all his thoughts perish with him. The wise man tells us, “That the fear of man bringeth a snare,” (Prov. 29:25). It made Abraham dissemble as if he had no wife; David changed his behaviour, as if he had no reason; Peter curse and swear as if he knew not his master: this fear disposes to apostacy, and must be cured by that fear of God, which disposes to suffering: when we are ready to drown in worldly sorrow, it is of singular use to spring another, a godly sorrow in our hearts; and when the fear of man puts us into trembling fits, it is an excellent remedy to raise up the fear of God in our souls above the other. Thus God directs his people not to fear the confederate enemies, but to “sanctify the Lord of Hosts himself, and to let him be their fear and their dread,” (Isa. 8:12, 13). He is Lord of Hosts, God over all, and the fear of him should be above all other fears; this is the way to have him to be a sanctuary to us, as it follows. If we fear him, he will be an inviolable place of retreat, where we may repose ourselves in a day of trouble.

2. It is not a diffidential fear, but a fiducial one that doth it: a diffidential fear makes the mind, as meteors in the air, to hang in suspense, and, in case affliction come, to fail under the burden. St. Peter walked upon the water to go to Jesus; but when he saw the wind boistrous, he was afraid, and began to sink, (Matth. 14:29, 30.) By faith he walked, and by diffidence he began to sink. Our condition is the very same; in the waves of a troublesome world we stand by faith, but fall by diffidence; that fear, which prepares us for suffering, must be a fiducial one. “Ye that fear the Lord, trust in the Lord, he is their help and their shield,” (Psa. 115:11). Holy fear is and must be in conjunction with faith. Fear flies from the evils of sin and hell; faith closes in with the promises of grace and glory; both concur to make a man fit for suffering; and such a sufferer shall have God for his help and shield.

3. It is not a servile fear, but a filial one that doth it: he that hath a mere servile fear of the wrath to come, may forbear an act of sin, but he hath the love of it in his heart; “adhuc vivit in eo peccandi voluntas” the love of sin lives in him still, as an ancient hath it. Such an one is not in a fit case to suffer for the truth; he hath not a love to God to move him to it, nor a capacity to have heaven after it; and how can he suffer? It is very hard for a man to suffer for a God that he loves not; or part with the good things of this world, when he hath no hope of those in a better. That fear, which prepares for suffering, is not servile, but filial; it stands not in conjunction with the love of sin, but with the love of God; the nature of it is such, that he that hath it will displease man rather than offend God; part with a world, rather then let go the truth and a pure worship; nay, and lay down his life rather then forfeit the divine presence and favour which are better than life. Thus much touching the nature of that fear, which prepares us for suffering.

2. I come to consider how holy fear doth prepare us for sufferings; and this I shall open in three things.

1. Holy fear looks upon sin as an evil much greater than any suffering: suffering is opposite to the creature, but sin is opposite to the infinite God; it is a rebellion to his sovereignty, a contradiction to his holiness, a provocation to his justice; an abuse to his grace; a stain cast, as much as in us lies, upon his glory; nay, as the schools speak, it is a kind of deicidium, it strikes in a sort at the very life and being of God; it wishes that there were none at all; and, if it could effect it, there should be none. Suffering doth not make a man worse then he was before, but sin doth it. Those saints that were destitute, afflicted, tormented, wandering in deserts, and mountains, and dens, and caves of the earth, were yet such excellent ones, “That the world was not worthy of them,” (Heb. 11:37, 38). On the other hand, Antiochus Epiphanes, (who was, as his name imports, illustrious and glorious in the world) was yet but a vile person, and was made such by his wickedness. Suffering strikes at the estate or body of man, but sin stikes at his soul, a thing more precious than a world; nay, and at the divine image there, which is more worth than the soul itself: it doth, where it can prevail, turn men into beasts in its sensual lusts, or into devils in its spiritual wickednesses: suffering may have good, nay great good in it, but sin is evil, only evil; it is called by St. James, περισσεία κακίας, the superfluity or excrement of all evil, (James 1:21). It contains all evils in it; and if all evils (saith a worthy divine) were to have a scum or excrement, sin is it, as being the abstracted quintessence of all evil, and having nothing at all of good in it. Sin, saith Bradwardine, is a thing not to be done, “pro quantiscunque bonis lucrandis, aut pro quantiscunque malis præcavendis,” for the gaining never so great a good, or for the avoiding never so great an evil. He that hath this holy fear in his heart, will choose suffering as the lesser evil, rather than sin, which is much the greater. When Antiochus Epiphanes brought forth wheels, rods, hooks, rakes, racks, cauldrons, cages, gridirons, gauntlets, awls, bellows, brazen pots, and frying-pans before Salamona and her seven sons to terrify them, they could not be induced by all his tormenting engines to trespass so far as to eat of a little sacrificed swine’s flesh, to save themselves from a cruel death. It was the saying of Anselm, That if sin were set before him on one hand, and hell on the other, he would rather choose hell than sin. Henry Flander, being a prisoner for the protestant religion, would not say that his wife was his whore, no, not to save his life, offered to him on those terms. Holy fear will tell us, that sin must not be done to avoid suffering; that we were better bear all reproaches than dishonour God; lose our estates than leave our religion; nay, and lay down our lives than be separated from the Divine love. O let us look upon sin as the maximum formidable; as that which hath in it the most proper cause of fear and flight, that no external miseries and dangers may be able to drive us into it.

2. Holy fear looks at the sufferings which God inflicts in hell, as incomparably greater than those which man doth or can inflict upon earth. Our Saviour directing our fear to its right object, takes notice of the vast difference between them, “Fear not them, which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear him, which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.” (Matt. 10:28.) Man’s killing is one thing, but God’s destroying another: man may kill the body, and it may be in a tormenting manner; but there is no death like the second; no torments on earth are comparable to those in hell; no finite arm can strike so hard as the infinite one; no culinary or elementary fire can burn so hot as the infernal doth. God bid Moses take and sprinkle the ashes of the furnace, and they should become boils and Mains. (Exod. 9:8, 9.) A great doctor of ours glosses on the words thus: The sufferings here on earth are but the ashes of the furnace, small things in comparison of the furnace itself; a hell of unquenchable fire. Man may kill the body, but he is not always a killing of it; he may torment, but he cannot bear up the patient in long suffering; the torments in a little time will cease, and the martyr sleep in Jesus; but God kills the damned, and is still a killing them, power supports them, and justice punishes them; the fire of hell, kindled by eternal breath, never goes out, and the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever: after thousands, and ten thousands of years, still there will be wrath to come, such as no time can measure. Man may kill the body, but after that he can do no more, his engines of cruelty cannot reach the soul, or touch the inward man, which is a sanctuary for God; but God kills the soul, his wrath is in a peculiar manner poured out there where the chief seat of sin was; the never-dying worm is ever growing upon conscience. The spirit of the damned furiously reflects upon itself over the eternal misery that it lies under. All the horrors of a Spira or a Judas are far short of that desperate rage and anguish which tortures the lost souls in hell. He that hath this holy fear in him will choose any sufferings on earth rather than those in hell. One of the sons of Solomona told the tyrant Antiochus, that his fire was cold, and indeed it was so, comparatively, to the fire of hell. St. Austin putting the question whom we should obey, God commanding one thing, or the emperor commanding another, makes his answer: “Da veniam, Imperator, tu carcerem minaris, ille gehennam,” Give place, O emperor, thou threatenest a prison, he a hell. When Polycarp was threatened with fire, his answer was, That the persecutor threatened only a momentary fire, but knew not the eternal one. He that ever heard that true thunder, which is the voice of God, would hardly be afraid of such artificial cracks as the emperor Caius Caligula used to make to shew himself a God. And he that carries upon his heart an awe of those sufferings which God inflicts in hell, will hardly fear those which men inflict on earth.

3. Holy fear looks upon spiritual and eternal losses, as incomparably greater than carnal and temporal ones. The loss of the world may be made up in the saving of the soul; but for the loss of a soul, nothing can make a recompense. That little sparkle of divinity mightily outweighs the great globe of the world. What are bodies to spirits; “Nemo (saith Austin) bene se inspexit, qui non omni corpori qualemlibet animam præponendam esse fateatur;” he that looks well into himself must confess, that any soul is to be preferred before all bodies. The loss of man’s favour may be richly made up by the presence of God’s. Moses endured the king’s wrath, as seeing the invisible one; the presence of God was so with him, that he feared no human frowns. But if the divine favour be wanting, nothing can supply the defect of it. It is true, a man without it may have all outward blessings flowing round about him; but he eats, and drinks, and sleeps, under the wrath of God, which hangs over his head, as the sword did over the head of Damocles at the tyrant’s table; and, as soon as the thread of life breaks, it comes down upon him in an utter ruin. The loss of creatures may be made up by an interest in God; a real christian, having nothing, may possess all things in him: but if a man forsake God, what will the world give in exchange for him? Its riches are but poor moth-eaten things, which in a little time vanish away; its pleasures are but the titillations of sense, and perish in the using; its honours are but a blast, a little popular air which soon go away, and come to nothing. When once God, who is the fountain and spring of all good, departs, it is in vain to hope for any thing from the little rivulets and cisterns of the creature. He that hath this holy fear in him, will choose to suffer loss in carnal and temporal things, rather than in spiritual and eternal. It is the saying of St. Ambrose, “Ea est vera pietas, quæ præponit divina humanis, perpetua temporalibus;” that is, true piety, which prefers divine things to human, and perpetual things to temporal. St. Austin sets out servile and filial fear by an adulterous and a chaste wife: “Timet mulier adultera, ne vir ejus veniat; timet et casta ne vir ejus abscedat:” The adulterous woman fears, lest her husband may come; the chaste woman fears lest her husband depart. In like manner servile fear makes us afraid that God will punish, and filial fear makes us afraid that God will depart. The loss of him is more than the loss of all things. When the Martyr Menas, under the persecution of Dioclesian, was brought forth to suffer, he gave this reason for it: “Nihil est, quod meâ sententiâ conferri possit cum regno cœlorum; neque enim totus mundus potest, æquâ lance expensus uni comparari animæ;” There is nothing, in my judgment, like the kingdom of heaven; neither may the whole world, if weighed in an equal balance, be compared with one soul. He had rather lose anything in the world than a heaven and a soul. O let us labour to know where the great loss lies, that we may never for sake spiritual and eternal things for carnal and temporal.
