# Chapter VI

The third direction for suffering in the knowledge of God—An ignorant man is not capable of suffering; neither will every knowledge serve the turn—The knowledge that prepares for sufferings, must be a well-rooted, a right estimating, a tasting or savouring, a practical or operative knowledge.

The third direction for suffering is this; If we would be in a fit posture for suffering, we must labour after the knowledge of God and the things of God. An ignorant man, who is a man in shape, but a beast in heart, is not a person capable of pious suffering; he knows not the principles of religion, and for what should he suffer? He hath no principles of grace in him, and how should he suffer? He is in darkness, and to him truth or error, one God or more, pure worship or idolatry, are all one; he is alienated from the life of God, (Eph. 4:18); and, therefore, it is not imaginable that he should die for God or his truth: for him to suffer for an unknown God or Christ, is to suffer for he knows not what. As the Samaritans worshipped they knew not what; so the ignorant man, if he suffer, suffers for he knows not what. The Athenians had an altar to the unknown God (Acts 17:23); and possibly they offered up other creatures to him: but for a man to offer up himself as a sacrifice to an unknown God, and to part with all this world when he knows nothing of a better, is a very strange unaccountable thing. Let us, therefore, cry after wisdom, and lift up our voice for understanding. “Let us seek her as silver, and search for her as for hid treasures,” as the wise-man exhorts, (Prov. 2, 3, 4). Let our prayers ascend up to heaven, to bring her down from thence; and our endeavours dig in the mines of scripture to fetch her up from thence, that so understanding may keep us, as it is, (v. 11). Knowledge is a perservative to him that hath it; “The people that know their God shall he strong,” (Dan. 11:32). “The young men, who have the word of God abiding in them, are strong,” (1 John 2:14). “Understanding is a well-spring of life to him that hath it, (Prov. 16:22). It streams out in living graces, and strengthens the inner-man, and prepares it for a day of trial: only it is to be remembered, that every knowledge will not do this, but it must be a well-rooted, a right-estimating, a tasting or savouring, a practical or operative knowledge that doth it.

1\. It must be a well-rooted knowledge that will prepare us for suffering.  Job tells his friends, That the root of the matter, or, as the original will bear, the root of the wood was in him, (Job 19:28.) He was sorely afflicted by God and men, yet he held fast his integrity, because he was not a man of mere leaves, but had a root of knowledge and grace in him. It is with christians as it is with trees, the more the tree is rooted in the ground, the faster it stands in a storm; the more a christian is rooted in evangelical truths, the firmer he stands in a time of persecution. Those of the stony ground received the word with joy, but fell off in time of persecution, because they had no root in themselves, (Matt. 13:21.) The heavenly truth did but lie upon the face of their hearts, and never sunk into them to become a virtual principle in them. The truth that we would suffer for, had not need be a loose notion, but truth in the hidden parts, fastened there as a nail in a sure place, sealed up to the heart by the Holy Spirit, engrafted and innaturalized in the mind that we may not let it go: we had need be grounded and settled in the faith, as the apostle speaks, (Col. 1:23). Grounded, as a house upon a sure foundation; and settled, as a man sitting fast in a chair: we had need have a good scripture bottom, and be firmly seated in the truth, that we may be capable of suffering for religion. The scripture tells us that there is but one God, one only to be worshipped and served, that his glory may not be given to another, nor his praise to graven images; that idols are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands; that they have mouths, and speak not; eyes, and see not; ears, and hear not; noses, and smell not; hands, and handle not; feet, and walk not: that the makers and worshippers of them are like unto them, as stupid as the senseless images are; that an idol is nothing, a thing of no moment or power at all, a mere nothing to be itself made a God, or so much as to represent one. If such truths as these, of which St. Cyprian hath given a great catalogue in his exhortation to martyrdom, be intimately radicated in the heart, they will strengthen it against idolatry.  The glorious martyr, Eulalia, seemed to be full of them, when in her great sufferings she sung, That Isis, Apollo, Venus, were nothing, and Maximianus, the worshipper of them, was himself nothing. O let us adhere to the holy truths in the word; these came down from heaven, and, like their original, are nothing but pure truth, without any mixture of error in them; these appear to us in the light of the first Truth, and lead to the bliss-making vision of him in heaven; and as we desire to be there, let us firmly adhere to them, especially to the word of Christ’s patience; the truth that must be suffered for at such a time as this, to that we must cleave closest, because in that will be the greatest stress and trial. It is good to be established in all truth, but now it is in a special manner necessary to be well fixed in the truth that concerns the pure religion, which runs very low in the christian world, while in the meanwhile the idolatrous one is like to be triumphant.

2. It must be a right estimating knowledge that will prepare us for suffering, every notion of the things of God will not do it; he that hath a high notion of them, but a low estimation, hath but a knowledge, falsely so called; he knows them not as he ought to know them, because he knows them only to know them, but not to value them: we must so know them as to rate them above a world; this is of great moment in order to suffering: a man is capable to suffer, or not, according as his estimate of spiritual things is higher or lower. When the martyr Polycarp was urged by the proconsul to deny Christ,  his answer was, “A potioribus non esse transeundum ad pejora;” we must not pass from better things to worse. He esteemed Christ better than the world, and therefore he suffered for him: but if he had esteemed the world better than Christ, he had never been a martyr: as the estimation is, so is the man. We know the evangelical truth, but if we do not rate it higher than all the world, we shall never be able to suffer for it; it is indeed in itself a glorious beam let down from heaven, a pure discovery of the great salvation that is in Jesus Christ, and in that respect incomparably more worth than all the world; but if we do not so account it, we shall fall from it to embrace the world, as being better in our eyes. It is very remarkable, that when the emperor’s prefect allured the great Basil to the Arian doctrine,  as being but a small thing, the holy man answered, That he would not part with one syllable of scripture, no, not to save his life. Such an esteem of truth is of excellent use to make a man adhere to it in an evil day. We know the pure worship, but if we do not prize it above all earthly things, we shall never be able to suffer for it: it is in itself a thing exceeding precious: it is the choicest part of life that is spent in it; the honour of God is more immediately concerned in it than in other things. That noble convert, Galeacius Caracciolus, who left all for Christ, prized one day’s communion with Christ more than all the gold or silver in the world; and if we can rate it so, we shall never turn aside from it to the idolatrous world, nor be carried into sin by the stream of the time: or say, as one going to mass did, Eamus ad communem errorem; let us go to the common error. We know the glory of Christ is to be promoted, but if we do not value it above our own reputation, we shall never suffer reproach for him. Moses esteemed the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt, (Heb. 11:26). Reproach in its-self is a vile thing, no way estimable, but the reproach of Christ hath an honour in it, and outshines all the glories of the world. Marsacus, a French soldier, being adjudged, with others, to the fire, and for his military service, not having, as others had,  a withe put about his neck, demands the reason why he might not be permitted to wear such a chain as his fellows did, and to be made of the same illustrious order as they were of? If we have such a divine spirit as this is in us, we shall count in a high honour to suffer reproach for Christ. A right estimation of things, is an excellent help to bear sufferings for religion.

3. It must be a tasting or savouring knowledge that will prepare us for suffering. “It is the taste of God’s word,” saith Dr. Jackson, “that sweetens sufferings to us, and makes us courageous to adventure upon all difficulties that are objected to deter us from entering into the land of promise.” Such speculative conceits of the food of life as we may find in the schoolmen, are of as little force to inflame our hearts with longing after that heavenly kingdom, as poetical descriptions of far countries are to make us undertake their conquest; we must have knowledge and sense, (Phil. 1:9), theory and experience too, to make us stand in the evil day; we must taste and see that the Lord is gracious, that we may be able to suffer for him. A spiritual relish of the sweet streams of grace that flow from him, is a choice preparative to make us take and drink of the bitter cup. Gotteschalcus suffered a close imprisonment for twenty years together, merely for preaching up the doctrine of grace: and it is without question, that he had not a mere notion, but an experimental taste of it in his sufferings. Many have the knowledge of Christ in a way of speculation, but we must have the savour of his sweet ointments upon our heart that we may follow him into suffering. We had need feel the sweetness of his blood in the calms of conscience, that we may shed our own blood for him. Let us not content ourselves to have Christ only in our bibles, but endeavour to have a proof of him in our hearts; a proof of his sweet-smelling sacrifice in our inward peace; a proof of his rich anointings in our supplies of grace. The experience of Christ in us, is a strong encouragement to suffer for him. He that hath a Christ only in notion, will fall off from him, but he that hath a tried Christ will hardly leave him.

4. It must be a knowledge practical and operative in the life, that will prepare us for suffering. A mere notional knowledge of Christ is not a right one; he that saith, “I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him,” (1 John 2:4); such an one contradicts himself; his conversation gives the lie to his profession; the truth is not in him in a practical way; his knowledge is but a flash, a vanishing vapour, that gives no vital influence to his life; he will not do other commands, much less will he take up the cross, which is a command more grievous to sense than others are. He that would be prepared for sufferings, must labour for such a knowledge as gives a proof of itself in holy obedience. Doing is a good preparative for suffering; he that sincerely doth other commands will take up his cross too, that being a command as well as others. He that indeed is subject to God’s commanding will, will be subject to his disposing one too, which orders the coining of the cross to us; it is the active christian that will, if occasion serve, be passive. Our Saviour Christ doth notably set forth what kind of christians will stand in time of persecution, and what will fall. “He that heareth his sayings and doth them, builds upon the rock, and when the storm comes, he stands fast, because he is founded upon the rock,” (Matt. 7:24, 25), that is, he is founded upon Christ by faith and obedience; and in the storm he continues upon him by patience; the rock bears him up as a part of itself; “but he that heareth Christ’s sayings, and doth them not, builds upon the sand, and when the storm comes, he falls,” (ver. 26, 27), because he is upon the sand; he hath no true foundation for his religion, he never did dig deep enough to come to self-denial, and therefore in the storm, his fall is very great, he and his religion utterly perish; as when a house is broke up from the very foundation, or a tree is blown up by the roots. Therefore, if we would stand firm and unmovable in a storm, let us labour to have such a lively and operative knowledge of Christ, as may diffuse itself into an universal obedience to his precepts. He that enures himself to do the will of God, will be ready, when the cross comes, to take it up, and say, This is the will of God too and must be done.

To conclude, that we may have this excellent knowledge, we must not only read the holy scriptures, but with Zuinglius, look up to heaven for that Holy Spirit that is able to lead us into all truth, and to seal it upon our hearts for ever.
