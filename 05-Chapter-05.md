# Chapter V

The second direction for suffering, mortification of sin; an unmortified man is not in a capacity to suffer—We must mortify all sin, particularly the unbelief of the heart, the love of the world in the three, great lusts of it; the hypocrisy in the heart, and the vain superstition that is there.

Having dispatched the first direction, I come to a second: if we would be in a posture for suffering, let us seriously set ourselves to mortify sin. There is in christians a double conformity to Christ’s death; the one stands in the mortification of sin; our old man is crucified with him, (Rom. 6:6), dying away by a secret virtue from his cross; the other stands in bearing the cross, thereby we fill up the afflictions of Christ, (Col. 1:24). The sufferings of Christ in his natural body were full, but the sufferings of Christ in his mystical body are daily to be filled up: the first conformity makes way for the second. The mortifying of inward lusts is an excellent preparative to the enduring of outward sufferings. An unmortified man, that is, under the power of his lusts, is in no fit capacity to suffer for Christ. He is a part of that world that lieth in wickedness; the world will love him as a part of itself, and he will comply with the world as a part doth with the whole: a little particle of water will, if it be possible, fall into a round drop, that it may answer to the figure of the great ocean whereof it is a part; and an unmortified man will be à-la-mode, and of the same figure (be it pagan or popish idolatry) with the corrupt world whereof he is a part; his compliance will be such that he will have no occasion for sufferings, neither is imaginable for what he will suffer from the world. Will he suffer, as good men do, to avoid that greatest of evils, sin? That is it which he allows and indulges in himself, that is the darling of his soul, the joy of his way, the current of his life, the only element in which he converses, and may he suffer to avoid such a thing as that is? Or will he suffer to avoid the greatest of punishments, hell and death? No, surely, in willing his lusts he virtually wills hell and the torments of it: in acting his sin, his feet go down to death, and all the wrath that is to come. Or will he suffer for God, out of love to him, and respect to his glory? It is not imaginable, that he should suffer for God whom he serves not, or love him with the idol in his heart, or respect his glory against whom he is in arms, and whose laws and honour he treads down under his feet. Or will he suffer for Christ his Saviour, who died to wash away his sins in his own blood? It is not credible that he should suffer for a Christ whom he never yet received, or take up the yoke of the cross when he casts off the yoke of the command; he cannot be saved in his sins, no, not by Christ himself: the atoning blood will not wash him that wallows in those corruptions that are the price of it. Or will he suffer for the gospel? He turns a deaf ear to the calls, violates the sacred commands, casts away the precious offers of it, and it is not to be thought that he will suffer for that gospel which he so despises. Indeed, it would be a very strange thing for him to suffer; in so doing he must part with all this world, in which his portion and total sum of happiness lies; he must suffer the spoiling of his goods, when he hath no enduring substance in heaven; be a reproach among men, when he hath no honour with God; and cast away a temporal life, when he hath no title to an eternal one. We see by these things that an unmortified man is not in case to suffer for Christ. Awake, therefore, O christian, set upon the work of mortification; resist inward corruptions, that thou mayest stand against outward temptations; lay holy restraints upon sin, that thou mayest bear a prison for Christ; die unto sin, that thou mayest be able to die for the gospel; set thy heart against every thing of concupiscence that breathes in thee, that there may be nothing to turn thee aside from the sure religion; cast out every secret idol out of thine heart, that thou mayest not fall down and worship the outward idols in the world. Do this work impartially, do not mortify one or two sins, but all. Every indulged lust is a traitor in thy bosom, a false bias upon thy heart: Spare it not. But to give some particular instances, labour to mortify the sins following.

1. Mortify the unbelief in thy heart. This is the foundation of apostacy, the greatest of sins, because the greatest separation from God, it departs from the living God, (Heb. 3:12); it gives the lie to the true God, (1 John 5:10); it blasts the precious gospel, as if it were not worthy to be obeyed in its precepts, or credited in its mysteries or promises. If it totally prevail in the heart, there can be no such thing as suffering for religion. To such an unbeliever Christ is but a fancy, and the gospel but a golden dream, for which suffering is plainly ridiculous; and if it be in thy heart but in some degree, it will in the same degree weaken thee and make thee ready to stagger at the cross. Watch, therefore, over the unbelief in thy bosom; assure thyself of this, that which inwardly departs from God will be ready to depart from him outwardly too; that which secretly gives him the lie, will be ready to deny him openly when suffering comes. Look narrowly to thy heart, if there arise there scruples touching the mysteries or promises of the gospel, bid them begone, drive them out of thy heart in the power of the word; these come to undermine thy Christianity and make thee fall in the day of trial. If distrusts and diffidential fears disquiet thee, chide thy base heart, charge it to trust in that God that never leaves those that are his. When thou art ready to sink in the deep waters, call to thy fearful heart, ask it why it doubts, the Lord will be with thee to bear thee up in his arms. When thou startest at the fiery furnace, tell thyself, that the Lord will be there, in those inward comforts which will make outward torments tolerable; set thy heart to hate and extirpate this cursed root of apostacy; expostulate with thy soul, and say, hath God let down a gospel of grace and salvation from heaven to us, and shall it not be believed? Hath he given us the two immutable things, his word and his oath, and wilt thou yet be such a wretch as not to believe him? Hath thy Saviour, Christ, sealed up the evangelical truth with his own blood, and wilt thou be so vile as not to seal it up by faith? Arm and strengthen thy heart against unbelief, that when the trial comes, thou mayest be ready to speak to thy soul, as Hilarion did, “Egredere, anima mea, egredere, quid times? quid dubitas?” Go out, my soul, go out; why dost thou fear or doubt? Heaven is ready for thee, and great is thy reward there,

2. Mortify the love of the world, the three great lusts mentioned, 1 John 2:16,—“The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life;” that is, the inordinate love of sensual pleasures, earthly riches, and worldly honour. These three make the world in the heart, and join us to the outward world, to become one with it. Unless these concupiscential chains be broken, we can never be in a posture for suffering; if thou wilt not part with a little sensual pleasure for Christ, thou wilt never suffer for him; if lust blind thee and turn thee into a brute, thou wilt be too low and base to be capable of it. He that is melted in the fire of lust, will not endure the flames of martyrdom; he that makes his belly his god, will never suffer to avoid idolatry. It is very observable in the prophet, that first he tells them, that Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart, (Hos. 4:11), and then adds, “My people ask counsel at their stocks,” that is, their idols, (v. 12). A sensual man, that is unhearted by his lusts, is much fitter to fall down to an idol, than to suffer for religion. Separate thyself, therefore, from the sensuality of the world, that thou mayest never fall into the idolatry of it. Put away the cup of pleasures, that thou mayest be in a capacity to drink of the cup of sufferings; the sensual cup leads to stings and torments; but the suffering one tends to the pure pleasures that are above. Again, if thou wilt not part with one earthly estate for Christ, thou wilt never suffer for him. When our Saviour bid the young man sell all, “he went away sorrowful,” (Matt. 19:22). St. Cyprian, speaking of some in his time that fell off in persecution, saith, that “Their estates were as chains and fetters to them;” that they could not go and suffer for Christ. The covetous man, who is a mental idolator, will, if occasion require, be an outward one too, and fall down to a stock or stone rather than lose his land. If thou wouldst be able to suffer for Christ, thou must break off the earthly chains from thy soul, that when the temptation comes, and thou art offered, as the blessed martyr Julitta was, to have thy estate upon the denial of Christ, thou mayest then be able to give the same answer as she did;—“Valeat vita, valeant meæ facultates;” Farewell life, farewell estate. Take heed that thy poor soul do not hang about houses and lands, when thou art called forth to suffer for Christ and the pure religion. Further, if thou wilt not part with thy worldly honour for Christ, thou wilt never suffer for him. An ambitious man will do anything for advancement; he will bow to an idol, that himself may be honoured; he lives upon a blast, a little popular air, and is too vain and light to suffer for religion; cast away, therefore, the love of mundane glory, that thou mayest bear the reproach of Christ; humble thyself before God, that thou mayest be able to suffer for his truth: count it an honour to suffer shame for Christ; be willing to be reproached for him who can give thee the Spirit of glory.

3. Mortify the hypocrisy that is in thy bosom. This sin is the art of seeming goodness, or vice in a visor. It is by this that men personate more grace than they have, and enlarge their forms of godliness beyond the power, and make a profession much greater than is ever filled up. It is from the remnants of this in good men, that they sometimes take false steps, and squint at bye-ends, and start aside from God like a deceitful bow: it is from hence that the saints now and then faint in their faith, cool in their love, and halt and make stops in their obedience. Watch, therefore, O christian, against this close evil; consider the vileness of it, think with thyself how grievous a thing it is to be false to that God, who makes all other things true to thee; the sun to give thee true light, and the creatures true nourishment; the blood to run right in thy veins, and the breath in thy nostrils. Loathe and abhor this abominable thing; cry to heaven for more truth in thy inward parts; labour to have the very power of religion, that thou mayest fill up thy profession; mourn over thy falls and withering graces, check thy starting heart and charge it to maintain a firm and close adherence to God, set thyself all manner of ways to root out and extirpate the remnants of hypocrisy out of thy heart, that, when thou comest to suffer for religion, thy heart may not deceive thee: truth in the heart is necessary in hearing, praying, repenting, believing, obeying, but above all, it is so in suffering for Christ; hypocrisy can personate all other graces, but usually it stumbles and discovers itself in a day of trial; therefore, mortify the secret guile that is in thy heart, that thou mayest stand fast under the cross.

4. Mortify the vain superstition that is in the heart. It is natural to us to desire the same thing as the children of Israel did, to have gods to go before us, to have visible images or pictures of the Deity, a pompous and stately worship, a gaudy religion made up of human additions and inventions, and such a way of serving God as is accommodated to sense and framed after the commandments of men; every one is ready to think in his false heart, what Ticonius said with his lips, Quod volumus sanctum est, that which we will is holy; that which in the worship of God is fine and decent, in our eyes, is so in God’s too. But consider with thyself; he that places his religion in such things as these, may chance to fall in love with that fine whore which is decked with gold and precious stones, (Rev. 17:4). He that will have a religion suitable to sense, will hardly stand to that religion which hath a cross annexed to it: if the command of man be the reason of thy worship, thou wilt turn to every point as that command doth vary: if thou canst nod in superstition, thou hadst need watch lest thou fall into flat idolatry. Remember, God is a Spirit; the true worshippers worship in spirit and truth; and the true worshippers will prove the true sufferers. Stand to the pure worship that thou mayest not fall into a corrupt one. Worship God in Spirit that thou mayest never fall down to an idol.
