# Chapter XIII

*The tenth direction for suffering, is patience under God’s will: with respect to the christian, it makes him possess his soul, conquer the world, and have inward satisfaction: with respect to God, it subjects the soul to his will; it waits upon God for strength and a good issue; it produces spiritual joy and praise.*

The tenth direction is this; if we would be in a fit posture for suffering, we must labour after patience under the will of God; this must be joined to our obedience, that we may be able to answer to all his will; as obedience respects God’s commanding will, so patience, which is also a duty, respects his disposing one. “Ye have need of patience, that alter ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise,” saith the apostle, (Heb. 10:36). We are not only to do other commands by obedience, but, when providence calls us to it, we are to do that of taking up the cross by patience. Other graces may help to bear the cross, but patience takes it up upon his back. It is its proper peculiar office ὑπομἐνειν, to make a man abide piously under the cross. This grace may be considered two ways; either in that which it doth with respect to the christian in whom it is, or in that which it doth with respect to God; both ways it is of singular use in order to sufferings.

1. Patience may be considered in that which it doth with respect to the christian in whom it is; and thus three things may be noted.

1. Patience makes a christian possess his soul, (Luke 21:19); there is a great difference between the worldly man’s patience and the christian’s. The worldly man endeavours much that he may possess the things that are without him, but the christian bears that he may possess his own soul. The christian, in a fit of impatience, loses himself, and puts himself as it were out of possession, not only of his rational faculties, but of his graces too; at that time he acts not like a man or a christian. When Jonah told God that he did well to be angry unto death, (Jonah 4:9), he was, in his furious passion, more like a beast than a man or a saint. “If thou deal thus with me,” saith Moses to God, “kill me out of hand,” (Numb. 11:15). The word thou here is of the feminine gender, at for atta; the perturbation of mind made Moses, the meekest man on earth, unable to fill up his words, or to speak as he meant to do. It is by patience that the christian possesseth himself, and hath the free use of his reason and holy graces: while he is patiently bearing the cross, his faith will roll out as gold out of the fire; his hope will fix itself in the unmovable heavens; his love will burn within him towards God and his glory. All the powers in earth and hell cannot put him out of the possession of himself, or hinder his graces from coming forth into act—he will be like himself in his suffering.

2. Patience makes a christian to be a conqueror of the persecuting world. The overcomer, mentioned in the second and third chapters of the Revelation of St. John, to whom so many precious and excellent promises are there made, is not one that overcomes by martial fighting, but one that hath the victory by patient suffering. “Who shall separate us,” saith St. Paul, “from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? In all these things, ὑπερνικῶμεν, we are more than conquerors through him that loved us,” (Rom. 8:35, 37). More than conquerors, because they conquered by suffering; while their bodies were slain, their souls were triumphing over death itself. Thus St. Austin saith, that the pagans were overcome, non à repugnantibus, sed a morientibus christianis, not by resisting, but by dying christians: patience makes their persecutors secure them, and frame crowns of glory for them. This made the martyr Vincentius tell his tormentor, “Nunquam aliquis adeò bene servivit mihi ac tu:” no man ever served me so much as thou hast done. Patience doth so frame the heart to the will of God, that it makes a christian to be a king over his crosses; losses to him are gain; reproaches, glory; confinement, liberty; and death, life: while he suffers in anything, he is above it.

3. Patience makes a christian to have inward content and satisfaction in suffering. It is the apostle’s exhortation, “Let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing,” (James 1:4). He that hath not patience, is but a lame and imperfect christian; he may go a little way in religion, as far as his principles reach, but if he come to suffering, which is beyond them, he will halt, and turn aside: but if a christian hath an effectual patience, he is then perfect and entire, wanting nothing; he hath everything that may fill up his Christianity or happiness in this life. The cross may come, but he hath principles to bear it: outward blessings may be taken away, but he hath all in God. St. Austin brings in patient Job, stripped of all, but only his God; speaking thus, Quid mihi deerit, si Deum habuero? quid mihi alia prosunt, si Deum non habuero? What can I want, if I have God? What can other things profit, if I have him not? Patience gives the suffering saint quiet and sweet satisfaction in God, and, not only so, but in the very suffering, as it is a pious submission to his will: there is a sweetness and a secret reward in the doing of God’s will, much more in holy suffering for him. The blessed martyr Baynham, at the stake, told the bloody papists, “O ye papists, ye talk of miracles! behold here a true one; these flames are to me a bed of roses.” It is true, all holy sufferers cannot say thus; but all of them find by experience, that there is a sweet satisfaction in suffering for the good God.

2. Patience may be considered in that which it doth with respect to God; and here are three things to be taken notice of.

1. Patience subjects the soul to the will of God; when the cross comes, the patient christians will, with Aaron, hold their peace; or if they speak, they will do it in some such language as that of Eli, “It is the Lord, let him do what seemeth him good.” Patience will instruct them to lie in the lowest posture of humility, and to argue the matter with themselves in this manner: Is God the rector of the world, and shall we not subject to him? His presence is in all, his power is over all, his wisdom and righteousness orders all. Who can stay his hand, or say to him, what dost thou? or call him to give account of any of his matters? To strive with him is folly; to murmur at any piece of his government is rebellion; to think that things might have been better, is to blaspheme his wise and just providence; and is he the Father of spirits, and shall we not be under him? We give reverence to the fathers of our flesh, and now much rather should we be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live? Our Saviour Christ, who suffered for us to sweeten sufferings to us, argued thus with himself: “The cup that my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?” (John 18:11). After his pattern, we should submit ourselves to suffering, remembering that, though it come through bloody hands to us, yet it is ordered by the Father of spirits; nay, and by the Father of mercies too, who assures us, That all things, (even afflictions among the rest,) shall work together for good. In those very sufferings, in which man is cruel, God will be merciful. While the world hates and persecutes us, God will embrace us in the arms of his love, and carry us through the cross to the crown of glory. Upon such accounts as these, patience doth subject the soul unto the cross. Our Saviour, the mirror of patience, being to drink up the cup of wrath, expresses himself thus: “Not my will, but thine be done,” (Luke 22:42). His will was swallowed up in his Father’s. St. Ambrose, in his commentary on those words, gives us this excellent note: Disce Deo esse subjectus, ut non quod ipse vis eligas, sed quod Deo scias esse placiturum: Learn to be subject to God, that thou mayest not choose, what thou wouldest, but what thou knowest to be pleasing to God. Patience teaches us to be pleased with God’s pleasure, and to will everything, not as it is in our own will, but as it is in God’s.

2. Patience waits upon God for strength to bear the cross, and for a good issue out of it: we have both these promised in that of the apostle,” God will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able, but will with the temptation make a way to escape,” (1 Cor. 10:13). In the first clause we have a promise of strength proportionable to the temptation; in the last, we have a promise of a good issue out of it. First, patience waits upon God for strength to bear the cross; this is the right method of obtaining strength: “Wait on the Lord, and he shall strengthen thy heard,” (Psa. 27:14). Strength comes in a way of dependance upon God. St. Austin speaks of a double patience; there is patientia super-borum, the patience of the proud; and patientia pauperum, the patience of the poor humble soul: the one waits upon the will of man, the other upon the grace of God: true patience knows, that it is God only that can strengthen the “inner man by his Spirit,” (Eph. 3:16). No other but his “glorious power can strengthen with all might unto all patience,” (Col. 1:11). Notable is that of St. Austin, “Hæc est vox martyrum, omnia tolerare, et de se nihil præsumere:” this is the voice of the martyrs, to bear every thing, and to presume of themselves nothing. Thus the noble martyr Potamenia, being threatened to be cast into a vessel of burning pitch, begged, that she might not be cast in all at once, but piecemeal, that they might see, how much patience the unknown Christ had given to her. True patience waits upon God for strength; but this is not all, it also waits upon God for a good issue out of the suffering; salvation belongs unto the Lord, and he gives many good issues to his suffering people: if they have an increase of graces and comforts, that is one good issue: if they hold out and persevere to the end, that is another good issue: if by death they pass from the cross to the crown, from a temporal life to an eternal one, that is the best issue of all: for such issues as these do patient souls wait, till the Lord put an end to all their troubles.

3. Patience produces spiritual joy and praise: this is the difference between philosophical patience and christian patience; philosophical may bear adversity, but christian hath joy in the bearing of it. It was the ancient custom of the primitive christians to have often in their mouths, Deo gratias, God be thanked for this mercy, and for that mercy. The patient christian, that looks upon the good issues of suffering, may sit down and sing, Deo gratias, not to blessings only, but to afflictions also. Job being stripped of all, cried out, “The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away, blessed be the name of the Lord,” (Job 1:21). St. Austin, speaking of Job, observes, That, when he had nothing of outward things, yet there were Gemmæ laudis Dei, the jewels of the praise of God found with him. Suffering saints have so much of the love of God shed abroad in their hearts, that they have præmium ante præmium, a lesser heaven before a greater. St. Paul saith, “ὑπερπερισσεύομαι, I superabound, or overflow in joy in all our tribulations,” (2 Cor. 7:4). The gracious presence of God, did not only cause joy, but the overflowing of it in his heart. St. James saith to the scattered christians, “Count it all joy, when ye fall into divers temptations,” (Jam. 1:2); that is, when ye fall into afflictions for the gospel. All joy? how can poor afflicted souls reckon thus? In the trial their graces appear in their pure beauty; strength is made perfect in weakness; consolations abound as much, nay, more than afflictions; the beams of divine love irradiate the heart, and fill it with a sweet serenity; hope enters heaven, and fixes upon the crown of life, and heaven comes down in a spirit of glory upon the heart. Here is joy, all joy indeed; the total sum of it in this life is made up in these things. It was the saying of the martyr, Mr. Philpot, “That to die for Christ is the greatest promotion that God can bring any unto in this vale of misery; yea, so great a honour as the greatest angel in heaven is not permitted to have.” It was the prayer of Mr. Bradford, the martyr: “God forgive me my unthankfulness for this exceeding great mercy, that among so many thousands, he chooseth me to be one in whom he will suffer. It was the observation of one of the ancients, “That it was peculiar to christians to give thanks in adversity.” Jews and Gentiles can praise God for benefits, but the patient christian can thank him for afflictions. O! let us labour after patience, that we may not only suffer for Christ, but do it with joy. Thus our Saviour directs his persecuted ones; “Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven,” (Matt. 5:12). Inward and outward joys are very proper in suffering saints, because then they are arrived at the highest pitch of Christianity, and ready to enter into the blessed heaven, there to enjoy God for ever and ever.
